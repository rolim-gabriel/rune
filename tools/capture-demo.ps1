# Records short looping demos of the running application for the website.
#
# The site's showcase rows are stills, and two of Rune's better moments are
# motion: dragging page thumbnails to reorder a document, and the sidebar
# sliding open before night mode inverts the page. This drives the real
# application and grabs a timed frame sequence. tools/gen-site-demos.ps1 turns
# those frames into the sprite sheets the site actually serves.
#
# The frames are real captures. index.html says "Every screenshot here is the
# real application, not a mockup", and that sentence has to keep being true.
#
# LICENCE AND PRIVACY. Shoot only a licence-safe document. PROJECT.md section 8b:
# the store screenshots use the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (a US
# Government work, so public domain) precisely so they can be published, and
# never the user's own files, because filenames leak in the tab strip and the
# recents list. A clip shows the tab strip for its whole duration, so this
# matters more here than for a still. This script also points the application at
# a throwaway state directory through RUNE_STATE_DIR (see MainWindow.xaml.cs)
# and seeds it with a clean state.json, so a recording cannot pick up real
# recents, theme or tabs. Note RUNE_STATE_DIR redirects the state store ONLY:
# ThumbnailCache, SignatureStore and ShareService each derive %LOCALAPPDATA%\Rune
# independently. None of them is on screen for these clips, but do not assume
# full isolation.
#
# ASCII only, no BOM: see the PROJECT.md section 7 note on PowerShell 5.1
# reading a BOM-less .ps1 as ANSI, where one stray byte swallows the rest of the
# file.
#
# THE TRAPS. PROJECT.md section 13 records seven traps in this harness, each of
# which presents as an application bug rather than a script bug. What is done
# about each:
#
#  1. The 40-byte INPUT struct on x64. Sidestepped: this uses keybd_event and
#     mouse_event, which take flat scalars and no struct at all. If you ever
#     switch to SendInput, assert Marshal.SizeOf is 40 before anything else.
#  2. DPI awareness. SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext runs FIRST, before
#     System.Drawing is even loaded, and then the window size is read back and
#     asserted. Without it every capture is cropped to about 80 per cent of the
#     window, and it looks like the header's right-hand buttons have vanished.
#  3. Bounded pixel searches. This never scans for a UI element, it computes
#     from the Tokens.xaml constants and the window's real DPI. Readiness is
#     asserted on three named rectangles, all clear of the floating zoom pill.
#  4. Window rect versus client coords. Three coordinate spaces are named and
#     never mixed: client, screen (what mouse_event wants) and capture (where a
#     point lands in a PrintWindow bitmap). Both offsets are printed and
#     asserted at startup.
#  5. $input.mi.dwFlags sets a field on a copy. Sidestepped with trap 1. Note
#     PowerShell 5.1 has no [ushort] accelerator either; it is [uint16].
#  6. SetCursorPos does not inject an input event. IT IS NOT USED HERE AND MUST
#     NOT BE. WinUI's drag machinery is fed from the input queue, so with
#     SetCursorPos the ListView never crosses the drag threshold, no floating
#     thumbnail appears and DragItemsCompleted never fires. That looks exactly
#     like drag-to-reorder being broken in the application.
#  7. Press and release need about 90 ms of dwell, never a shared timestamp.
#
# Two more, found while writing this and not yet in section 13:
#
#  8. Arrow keys and PageUp/PageDown are extended keys. Without
#     KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY on both down and up, Shift+Down silently fails to
#     extend the thumbnail selection, which looks like SelectionMode="Extended"
#     being broken.
#  9. mouse_event's absolute coordinates are normalised 0..65535 over the
#     primary monitor, not pixels. Absolute rather than relative also removes
#     pointer-acceleration nondeterminism, which is what makes a take
#     repeatable.
#
# Nothing else may hold the foreground while this runs: synthetic input lands in
# whichever window has focus and the capture follows it. Start it and step away
# from the keyboard.
