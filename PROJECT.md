## 1. What this is

**Rune** is a free, open-source (**GPLv3**) PDF reader for Windows. It was
started 2026-07-12 under the working title *Folio* and renamed to *Rune* at
v0.1 (English-recognizable, Nordic "writing" connotation, avoids the crowded
"Folio" trademark space).

**Goal:** the speed of SumatraPDF/Zathura **and** the modern look of macOS
Preview / GNOME Papers **and** a lightweight footprint — no existing Windows
viewer is all three at once. Keyboard-first, in the spirit of SumatraPDF and
Flow Launcher.

- **GitHub:** https://github.com/DanialJaved/rune (public; `gh` CLI is
  authenticated as `DanialJaved`)
- **Owner/dev:** Danial Javed — new to C#/.NET, Rust, and web stacks; explain
  non-obvious .NET concepts (P/Invoke, async, XAML binding) while building.

## 2. Tech stack (decisions are settled — don't re-litigate)

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Language/runtime | **C# / .NET 10** | |
| UI | **WinUI 3** (Windows App SDK **2.2.0**, referenced as sub-packages — see §7) | Fluent, Mica, dark mode |
| PDF engine | **PDFium** via `bblanchon.PDFium.Win32` NuGet (153.x) | Chrome's renderer; BSD-3-Clause/Apache-2.0 |
| Canvas | **Win2D** (`Microsoft.Graphics.Win2D` 1.4.0) | virtualized `CanvasVirtualControl` |
| MVVM helpers | `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm` 8.4.2 | used lightly |
| Build model | Unpackaged self-contained `.exe` for dev; MSIX at release | |

**Built from scratch, not a fork.** PDFium provides the proven renderer so
"from scratch" only meant the app shell + interop.

## 3. Solution layout

`Rune.slnx` (new `.slnx` solution format) with four projects:

```
src/
  Rune.PdfiumInterop/   Thin P/Invoke bindings over pdfium.dll
    NativeMethods.cs      Raw [DllImport] signatures (fpdfview/doc/text/annot/edit/save)
    PdfiumNative.cs       Public facade so the engine never touches DllImports
    PdfiumLibrary.cs      Global FPDF_InitLibrary + the serialization lock
    PdfiumFormEnvironment.cs  FPDF_FORMFILLINFO callbacks — the only way to set a
                          field value, since FPDFAnnot_SetFormFieldValue does not exist
    FileAccessAdapter.cs  FPDF_FILEACCESS bridge → lazy FileStream reads (huge/Unicode paths)
    PdfiumException.cs     Maps FPDF_GetLastError to friendly messages

  Rune.Engine/          Document services (no UI dependency)
    PdfDocument.cs        Open/render/page-sizes/outline/links/properties (partial class)
    PdfDocument.Annotations.cs  AddMarkup/AddNote/AddInk/GetAnnotations/RemoveAnnotation/
                          Capture+RestoreAnnotation (undo)/SaveAs/IsDirty
    PdfDocument.Pages.cs  DeletePages/MovePages/ExportPages/InsertPages(FromFile)/RestoreMovedPages
    PdfDocument.PageCache.cs  Stable FPDF_PAGE handles across operations (v0.5.0) —
                          PDFium needs one page handle to survive keystrokes
    PdfDocument.Forms.cs  AcroForm fill: FormClick/FormChar/field geometry, XFA detection,
                          Get/SetFieldAppearance (the /DA rewrite + forced repaint)
    FieldAppearance.cs    The /DA grammar: read and rewrite size + colour, conservatively
    PdfDocument.Stamps.cs Image stamps: AddStamp/MoveAnnotation/ResizeStamp/
                          TryReadStampImage/GetStampKind (the signature mechanism, and
                          the picture one — StampKind tells a text box from a picture)
    PdfDocument.Text.cs   Real text on a page: AddTextBox writes one text object per
                          line and measures what PDFium built; TryReadTextBox reads the
                          words, size, face and colour back out; ResizeTextBox
                          re-renders at a scaled size. TextBoxContent owns the
                          standard-14 name in both directions (v0.7.0)
    PdfDocument.Flatten.cs   FPDFPage_Flatten — bakes annotations into page content
    PdfDocument.Signatures.cs  Read-only report of what a signed file CLAIMS. Never verifies.
    SignatureMatte.cs     Keys the paper out of a photographed signature; also the
                          shared BGRA helpers (premultiply, crop, quarter-turn rotate)
    SignatureCoverage.cs  /ByteRange arithmetic: does a signature cover the whole file
    RenderScheduler.cs    THE single render thread + priority op queue (see §4)
    PageText.cs           Per-page text + char boxes → managed selection hit-testing
    PageLayout.cs         Immutable vertical-stack layout (zoom/rotation, min viewport w/h)
    PageRotationTransform.cs  Unrotated page space ↔ the drawn box (v0.6.0). The reason
                          selection/forms/signing work while rotated — see §9
    ViewRotationMath.cs   Quarter-turn normalization (C# % keeps the left operand's sign)
    ZoomAnchor.cs         Keeps the point under the cursor still while zooming
    TouchMetrics.cs       The few numbers that differ between a fingertip and a
                          mouse pointer: hit slop, handle reach, the tap-vs-drag
                          threshold. Zero (or the old constant) for a mouse, so
                          the tests pin that nothing moved for one
    Tiles.cs              TileKey + TileMath (MaxSingleTilePx = 1024 — see §7 gotcha)
    PageBitmap.cs         Pooled BGRA pixel buffer (ArrayPool)
    ThumbnailMetrics.cs   Aspect-correct thumbnail box sizing
    DipRect.cs            Simple rect struct in device-independent px
    OutlineItem.cs        TOC node model
    PdfLink.cs            Clickable-link model
    TextModels.cs         TextRect / TextSelection / SearchHit
    DocumentSearch.cs     Full-document text search (routes through the op queue)
    UndoStack.cs          Bounded per-document undo/redo stack (generic)
    BookmarkRemap.cs      Pure page-index remap math (delete/insert/move)
    ErrorLog.cs           Append-only crash log; every method swallows its own failures
    AppState.cs           RecentFile(+Bookmarks)/SessionState/AppSettings/AppState/AppStateStore
                          (namespace Rune.Services — physically here so it's unit-testable)

  Rune.App/             WinUI 3 shell
    App.xaml(.cs)         Entry point; command-line file open; AppWindow icon;
                          merges Styles/Tokens.xaml + Styles/Controls.xaml
    MainWindow.xaml(.cs)  Shell: TabView-in-titlebar, SLIM header + hamburger menu,
                          floating zoom pill, find bar, presentation/shortcuts/bookmark/
                          undo wiring, settings/palette, drag-drop, homepage grid,
                          page extract, "Report a problem"
    MainWindow.Tools.cs   The annotation toolbar's tool flyouts (pen/highlighter/sign),
                          and the picture tool's pick-decode-arm path
    MainWindow.TextTool.cs  The text tool's shell half: its button and the floating
                          format bar (font/size/bold/italic/colour), built in code so
                          the lists come from TextBoxFonts alone (v0.7.0)
    ShortcutCatalog.cs    Single source of truth for the F1 shortcuts overlay
    Styles/Tokens.xaml, Styles/Controls.xaml   spacing scale + shared control styles
    Styles/RuneColors.cs  Every colour Win2D draws (XAML uses {ThemeResource})
    Controls/
      PdfViewer.xaml(.cs)     The viewport: Win2D canvas, virtualized scroll, zoom,
                              tiles, text selection, search, links, ink, night mode,
                              page-mutation refresh, annotation undo events
      PdfViewer.Forms.cs      Form-field hit-testing, keystroke routing, field borders
      PdfViewer.StampPlacement.cs  Arming, the hover ghost, placement. One pipeline for
                              a signature and a picture; only the source differs (v0.7.0)
      PdfViewer.TextEditing.cs  The on-page text box: a real XAML TextBox over the
                              canvas, anchored to a page point (v0.7.0)
      PdfViewer.ObjectSelection.cs  Selecting anything placed: move, corner handles,
                              and the one difference between the two kinds — a picture
                              is rescaled, text is re-rendered at a new size (v0.7.0)
      DocumentView.xaml(.cs)  Per-tab: viewer + sidebar (thumbnails/chapters/bookmarks
                              switcher), page editing (reorder/delete/clipboard/insert/
                              extract), undo stack owner, lazy open, save-in-place
      SignaturePad.xaml(.cs)  The Add-a-signature dialog: draw, type or import
      SignatureFonts.cs       Which of Windows' handwriting faces this PC actually has
      NoticeHost.xaml(.cs)    The app's ONLY message surface (floating card, v0.5.0)
      PresentationView.xaml(.cs) F5 fullscreen one-page-at-a-time overlay (tiled)
      CommandPalette.xaml(.cs) Ctrl+K fuzzy command palette
      BookmarkItem.cs, AnnotationEdit.cs, AnnotationTool.cs, ThumbnailItem.cs,
      OutlineNode.cs, RecentCard.cs
    Services/
      DialogHost.cs           Serializes every ContentDialog (WinUI allows ONE — see §7)
      FilePickerHost.cs       Every file picker in the app: owner window, one retry, honest failure
      PageClipboard.cs        App-wide page clipboard (serialized bytes, cross-tab)
      PrintService.cs         PrintManagerInterop + PrintDocument (live preview, page ranges)
      SignatureStore.cs       Saved signatures as PNGs under %LOCALAPPDATA%\Rune
      ThumbnailCache.cs       Homepage first-page thumbnails (disk-cached PNGs)
    Package.appxmanifest      Store identity + .pdf file-type association (§8b)
    Assets/                   rune.ico + MSIX visual assets (generated)

tests/
  Rune.Tests/           xUnit — 427 tests against a generated corpus (see §6)

tools/
  gen-corpus.ps1        Hand-authors the test PDFs (no PDF lib needed)
  gen-icon.ps1          Draws the raido-rune icon + all MSIX assets
  check-package.ps1     Asserts the .NET runtime is actually inside an MSIX
  gen-site-images.ps1   Store screenshots to resized JPEGs in site/img
  gen-site-shortcuts.ps1 Rewrites the shortcut table in site/features.html from
                        ShortcutCatalog.cs, so app and site cannot disagree
  capture-demo.ps1      Drives the running app and grabs a timed frame sequence
                        for the website's looping demos. Read its header and
                        section 13's trap list before touching it.
  gen-site-demos.ps1    Stacks a take into one JPEG strip and writes the
                        matching element into site/index.html

site/                   The website: three hand-written HTML pages and one
  index.html            stylesheet. No generator, no build step, no
  features.html         dependencies, and NO JAVASCRIPT AND NO THIRD-PARTY
  privacy.html          REQUESTS AT ALL, which is what lets privacy.html say
  style.css             what it says. Keep it that way: no analytics, no CDN
  img/                  fonts, no embedded sponsor widget. Every path must stay
                        relative, because Pages serves it from a /rune/ subpath.

## 4. Architecture & rendering model (the important part)

```
WinUI shell (tabs in title bar, slim header + hamburger, floating zoom pill)
   └─ PdfViewer: Win2D CanvasVirtualControl inside a ScrollViewer
        └─ LRU tile cache (128 MB byte budget, ArrayPool buffers)
             └─ RenderScheduler: ONE dedicated thread
                  ├─ desired-tile list (visible > previews > prefetch)
                  └─ priority op queue (Interactive > tiles > Thumbnail > Background)
                       └─ thin P/Invoke → pdfium.dll
```

- **PDFium is NOT thread-safe.** ALL PDFium work is serialized through the
  single render thread (`RenderScheduler`), with the global lock
  (`PdfiumLibrary.Lock`) as a backstop. **Nothing calls PDFium on the UI
  thread anymore** — this was the v0.3 "random freeze" cause (v0.4 §9).
- **Two kinds of render-thread work, interleaved by priority:** the
  desired-tile list (reconciliation — see below) and one-off ops via
  `RunAsync(PdfWorkPriority, …)`. Loop order each pass: Interactive op → front
  desired tile → Thumbnail op → Background op. So selection/annotation edits
  outrank tile rendering, and tiles outrank sidebar thumbnails and search.
- **RenderScheduler uses desired-state reconciliation for tiles, not a queue.**
  The UI hands over the full prioritized "tiles I want right now" list
  (`SetDesired`), replacing the previous list. The loop always renders the
  front-most missing tile. Scrolling past something simply drops it from the
  next list — no stale work, no cancellation bookkeeping.
- **Text selection never touches PDFium on the pointer path.** Each visible
  page's text + per-char boxes are extracted once (`PageText`, via
  `FPDFText_GetCharBox`) and cached; hit-testing and range-rects are pure
  managed lookups. Desired-tile recompute is coalesced (50 ms) during scroll.
- **Progressive rendering:** each page draws white → stretched low-res preview
  (~216px, the "blurry-fast" pass) → crisp tiles at the exact current scale.
- **Tiles:** pages ≤ 1024px render as one bitmap; larger pages split into a
  1024px grid. Above the cap they're tiled.
- **Zoom** is native ScrollViewer `ZoomMode` (touch pinch, touchpad pinch,
  Ctrl+wheel all handled) folded into the real zoom on gesture-end via
  `RebaseZoom` — raster-scaled during the gesture, crisp after.
- **Coordinate spaces:** PDF page space is bottom-left origin; the app works in
  top-left "page points". `FPDF_PageToDevice` / `FPDF_DeviceToPage` convert
  (rotation-safe) — used for links, text, and all annotation geometry.
- **State/persistence:** JSON at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Rune\state.json` (recents,
  session tabs+positions, settings, **per-document bookmarks**). Thumbnails
  cached at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Rune\thumbnails\`. Migrates once from legacy `\Folio`.
- **UI is GNOME-Papers-proportioned** but native Windows (Mica + Fluent):
  one slim header row of flat icon buttons, everything else in a hamburger
  `MenuFlyout`; a floating zoom pill bottom-right. Spacing/typography come from
  `Styles/Tokens.xaml` + `Styles/Controls.xaml` (the only place new
  spacing/size constants live) — no per-control magic numbers.

---

## 5. Feature set (as shipped in v0.8.0)

- Tabs **in the title bar** (Chrome/Terminal style), lazy-loaded per tab
- Continuous virtualized scroll; zoom 10–640% at cursor; fit-width/page; rotate
- **Sidebar open by default** (Settings toggle) with a Papers-style bottom
  switcher: **thumbnails / chapters (TOC) / bookmarks**; internal & web links;
  back/forward
- **Full keyboard navigation** (always on): arrows scroll/page, PageUp/Down,
  Home/End, plus vim keys (Settings toggle)
- Text selection & copy; find-in-document with highlight-all + hit stepping
- **Annotations** (standard PDF annots via `FPDF_annot` + `FPDF_SaveAsCopy`):
  highlight / underline / strikeout from selection, sticky notes, and
  **freehand ink** (colour/width panel on the pen button itself). Right-click to delete.
  Save (Ctrl+S) / Save As (Ctrl+Shift+S). Dirty tab marker `•` + save prompt.
- **Page editing** in the thumbnail sidebar: multi-select, drag-to-reorder,
  Delete, **Ctrl+C/X/V page clipboard incl. across tabs**, drop an external
  `.pdf` into the sidebar to insert its pages. Serialized-bytes clipboard.
  **Extract** the selection to a new file (context menu + palette), which leaves
  the open document untouched.
- **Everything interactive works while the view is rotated** (v0.6.0) —
  selection, markup, links, form filling, signing. `PageRotationTransform` maps
  between unrotated page space and the drawn box; find results and selection now
  survive a Ctrl+R rather than being cleared.
- **Undo / redo** (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y): unified per-document stack over
  annotations (spec-based re-create) and page ops (snapshot / inverse-permute).
  Cleared on save-in-place + close. Dynamic menu labels.
- **User bookmarks** (Ctrl+B): named, per-document, persisted; sidebar pane
  with rename/delete/jump.
- **Presentation mode** (F5): fullscreen one-page-at-a-time, arrows/Space/click
  to advance, Esc/F5 to exit; lands the reader on the last shown page.
- **Keyboard shortcuts overlay** (F1 / Ctrl+?): GNOME-style two-column window,
  driven by `ShortcutCatalog` (single source of truth).
- **Night mode** (Ctrl+I): GPU `InvertEffect`, one cached effect per viewer
- **Command palette** (Ctrl+K): fuzzy filter + "Go to page N" + recents
- **Recent-docs homepage**: clean grid of aspect-correct thumbnail cards with
  theme-aware placeholders + empty state (thumbnails a Settings toggle)
- **Form filling** (AcroForm text/checkbox/radio/combo/list): PDFium's form-fill
  environment drives every edit through `FORM_OnChar` — there is no programmatic
  setter — with Rune-drawn field borders over the top. Values round-trip through
  save. **Text colour and size** are settable per field (right-click → "Text
  appearance…"), by rewriting the widget's `/DA` — see §7 for why the repaint is
  the hard half. `Ctrl+Shift+</>` steps the size from the keyboard, and
  `Ctrl+B`/`Ctrl+I` swap the `/DA`'s font resource for its conventional sibling
  (`Helv`↔`HeBo`, `TiRo`↔`TiBo`/`TiIt`/`TiBI`, `Cour`↔…). That resource has to
  exist in the AcroForm's `/DR` and PDFium exposes no way to read it, so the
  change is **verified by rendering** the widget before and after: a field that
  comes back blank gets its old `/DA` put back and the shell says the file
  cannot carry that font.
- **Signing**: draw a signature, **type it** in one of Windows' handwriting faces
  (`SignatureFonts`, nothing bundled), or **import a photo or scan and have the
  paper keyed out automatically** (`SignatureMatte`). Placed as a stamp annotation
  with a live semi-transparent preview under the cursor, wheel-sizing before
  placement, and drag-to-move **or aspect-locked corner-handle resize** after.
  Saved signatures are reusable and stay on the device.
- **Text on a page** (`Ctrl+T`, v0.7.0): click anywhere, blank or not, and type.
  A floating bar offers font, size, bold, italic, **underline** and **alignment**
  plus colour, applied live. Stored as **real text objects** inside a stamp
  annotation, not a raster, so it is crisp at any zoom and becomes ordinary
  searchable page text once flattened. The editor is a real XAML `TextBox` over
  the canvas (IME, selection, clipboard and screen readers for free), anchored to
  a page point.
  - A box has a **width** once one has been dragged for it, and the words **wrap**
    to it. Alignment (left / centre / right / justify) positions each line inside
    that width; justify emits one text object per word, since PDF cannot stretch
    the gaps inside a single run. An underline is a filled rectangle path per
    line, placed from the baseline and the font's descent.
  - Underline, alignment and the box width live in a private `/RuneStyle`
    annotation key, because PDF has nowhere standard to put any of them on a
    stamp and inferring them from the objects guesses wrong on a one-line box.
    Other readers ignore the key; the words in `/Contents` stay interoperable.
  - **The editor cannot preview the underline.** WinUI's `TextBox` has no
    `TextDecorations` (only `RichEditBox` does) and hand-drawn rules would need
    per-line metrics the control does not expose. The bar's `U` shows the state;
    the rule lands on commit.
- **Pictures** (v0.7.0): place any PNG/JPEG/BMP/GIF/TIFF through the same
  arm → ghost → click-or-drag → `AddStamp` pipeline signatures use. **No
  matting**: `SignatureMatte` exists to remove paper from a photographed
  signature, and a picture the user chose should land as it is.
  **`Ctrl`+wheel sizes the ghost; the plain wheel scrolls.** It was the other way
  round through v0.7.0, which meant you could not scroll to the spot you wanted
  to drop the picture on without first putting the tool away.
- **Share** (menu → Share…, or the palette): hands the PDF to another app
  through the Windows share sheet, via `DataTransferManagerInterop` for the same
  reason printing uses `PrintManagerInterop` — there is no CoreWindow in a
  desktop app. Unsaved edits go out as a copy under the document's own name in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Rune\share`, swept an hour later; the original is never
  written to. **The only thing in Rune that hands a document to anything else,
  and only when asked** — see PRIVACY.md.
- **One selection model** (v0.7.0): anything placed is selectable with a plain
  click, then movable, resizable by corner handles, and deletable. A picture is
  resized by rescaling its pixels and is **aspect-locked**. A text box is not:
  the drag sets its **width** and the words **re-flow at the same point size**,
  with the height coming back from the wrap. Only the size picker and
  `Ctrl+Shift+</>`  change how big the type is.
- **Signature details**: reports what a signed document *claims*, including
  whole-file coverage. Deliberately does **not** verify — see the disclaimer in
  `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, which must never be softened.
- **Flatten** (`PdfDocument.Flatten`): bakes annotations and form values into
  page content for a fixed, non-editable copy.
- **Touch** (v0.8.0): the app can be read and edited with a finger. Nothing in
  it had ever asked what kind of pointer was touching it, and the consequence
  was worse than a rough edge: pressing on a glyph captured the pointer, which
  stops the ScrollViewer panning, so on a page of prose **a finger could not
  scroll the document at all**.
  - **A plain touch drag is a scroll.** A drag means anything else only when a
    tool is armed, or when the drag starts on something already selected. Both
    are decidable on the press, which turns out to be the only moment they can
    be decided (§7).
  - **Hold to select a word**, and the lift raises the same menu a right-click
    does, so highlight / underline / strikeout / copy are all reachable. A
    press landing on that selection drags it wider. Double-tap takes a word too.
  - **Form fields raise the soft keyboard** through `InputPaneInterop`. A PDF
    field is pixels PDFium drew rather than a XAML text input, so Windows saw
    nothing take focus and a field could be tapped and then never typed into.
  - **Bigger targets where a miss costs something**: hit slop on links, fields
    and stamps, a 24 DIP reach on corner handles that keep their 10 DIP drawn
    size, and a looser tap-versus-drag threshold so finger jitter stops sizing a
    picture at random. All of it is zero or unchanged for a mouse
    (`TouchMetrics`, pinned by test).
  - **Palm rejection**: only the contact that began an ink stroke may extend it,
    and touch is ignored while a pen is drawing.
  - **Routes for what only a keyboard could reach**: a second tap on a tool
    button disarms it (Note, Image and Eraser have no options panel and so no
    Done button, which left a tablet stuck in eraser mode), delete moves into
    the hold menu, bookmark and the palette into the hamburger, and presentation
    goes back on a left-third tap rather than a right button.
  - The find bar, zoom pill, sidebar switcher and Home button are sized from a
    `TouchTargetMin` token. The 34 px header buttons are deliberately left as
    they are: they sit in a 44 px bar with 2 px gaps, so a miss hits a
    neighbour rather than the page.
- Session restore; printing with preview + page ranges
- **Document properties** (`Ctrl+D`): sectioned rather than a flat list, and
  blanks are shown as blanks — a missing Author row could not be told apart from
  an Author nobody had looked for. Metadata with dates parsed out of PDF's
  `D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSS+HH'mm'` syntax; page count and the current page's size named
  (`Letter — 216 × 279 mm`) with a note when pages differ; encryption and the
  permission bits spelled out; tagged / form kind / attachment count; path, size
  and PDF version. **Fonts fill in after the dialog opens**, at Background
  priority and capped at 50 pages, because that one section costs a page walk.
- **Report a problem** (menu): version, Store vs portable, Windows build, and the
  path to `errors.log`, with buttons to the issue tracker and the log folder.
  With no telemetry by design this is the only route a crash reaches anyone.

### Keyboard shortcuts (see `ShortcutCatalog.cs` for the authoritative list)
| Action | Keys |
|---|---|
| Open / close tab | `Ctrl+O` / `Ctrl+W` |
| Scroll / page up-down | `↑ ↓` / `PgUp PgDn`, `Space` `Shift+Space` |
| Previous / next page | `← / →` (vim: `p` / `n`) |
| First / last page | `Home` / `End` (vim: `gg` / `G`) |
| Back / forward | `Alt+←` / `Alt+→` |
| Find / next / prev | `Ctrl+F` / `F3` / `Shift+F3` |
| Command palette / shortcuts | `Ctrl+K` / `F1` (or `Ctrl+?`) |
| Zoom in/out/100%/fit page/fit width | `Ctrl++` / `Ctrl+-` / `Ctrl+1` / `Ctrl+0` / `Ctrl+2` |
| Night / sidebar | `Ctrl+I` / `F9` |
| Rotate right / left | `Ctrl+R` / `Ctrl+Shift+R` |
| Presentation / bookmark | `F5` / `Ctrl+B` |
| Highlight / pen / text | `Ctrl+H` / `Ctrl+E` / `Ctrl+T` |
| Save / save as | `Ctrl+S` / `Ctrl+Shift+S` |
| Pen, highlighter, note, text, picture, sign, eraser | annotation toolbar (only the pen and text have chords) |
| Size a picture before dropping it | `Ctrl`+wheel (the plain wheel scrolls) |
| Move / resize / delete something placed | click it, drag it or a corner, `Delete` |
| Copy / cut / paste (text or pages) | `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+X` / `Ctrl+V` |
| Undo / redo | `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` |
| Print / properties | `Ctrl+P` / `Ctrl+D` |

**While a text box is open or a form field has the caret**, these chords belong
to the text and not to the document — `Ctrl+B` bolds rather than bookmarking,
`Ctrl+I` italicizes rather than flipping night mode, `Ctrl+E` centres rather than
arming the pen, `Ctrl+R` aligns right rather than rotating. `Esc` closes the box
and hands every one of them straight back. `AddAccelerator` takes the document,
text-box and form-field meanings side by side for exactly this reason.

| Action (text box / form field only) | Keys |
|---|---|
| Bold / italic / underline | `Ctrl+B` / `Ctrl+I` / `Ctrl+U` |
| Bigger / smaller | `Ctrl+Shift+>` / `Ctrl+Shift+<` |
| Left / centre / right / justify | `Ctrl+L` / `Ctrl+E` / `Ctrl+R` / `Ctrl+J` |

Vim keys (`j k h l`, `gg`/`G`, `p`/`n`) are a Settings toggle. Page
copy/cut/paste applies when the thumbnail sidebar has focus; otherwise
`Ctrl+C` copies selected text.

### Touch gestures (v0.8.0)

A finger has no hover, no second button and no wheel, and it competes with the
ScrollViewer for every drag. These are the gestures that fill those gaps; a
mouse behaves exactly as it always did.

| Action | Gesture |
|---|---|
| Scroll / zoom | Drag / pinch (a plain drag is always a scroll) |
| Select a word | Press and hold, or double-tap |
| Widen a selection | Press on it and drag |
| Highlight, underline, strikeout, copy, delete | Press and hold, then pick from the menu |
| Type in a form field | Tap it; the soft keyboard comes up on its own |
| Put a tool away | Tap its toolbar button again |
| Previous page in presentation | Tap the left third of the screen |

Two things a finger still cannot do: select **several pages** in the thumbnail
sidebar (`SelectionMode="Extended"` acts as single-select under touch, so page
copy/cut/extract wants Ctrl or Shift), and read the **tooltip** that is the only
label on 20-odd icon-only buttons.

## 6. Build / run / test (CLI only — **no Visual Studio installed**)

```powershell
# Build
dotnet build src/Rune.App/Rune.App.csproj -p:Platform=x64

# Run (accepts an optional PDF path; also --page N --zoom Z for scripted tests).
# Rune is single-instance: a second launch hands its file to the running window
# as a new tab and exits (Services/SingleInstance.cs). --new-window opts out.
src/Rune.App/bin/x64/Debug/net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0/win-x64/Rune.exe [file.pdf] [--new-window]

```

**Test corpus** (`tests/corpus/`, generated): `hello.pdf` (2pp smoke),
`book-1000.pdf` (perf), `linked.pdf` (outline + internal/URI links),
`corrupt.pdf` (must throw, never crash). Tests cover interop/render, rotation
content, tile math, layout (incl. min-viewport-height), scheduler priorities +
cancellation, `PageText` selection parity with PDFium, outline, links,
text/search, `AppState` + bookmark persistence, `BookmarkRemap`, page editing
(delete/move/export/insert round-trips), and undo/redo (annotation spec
capture/restore, page snapshot restore, stack caps).

**Verifying TOUCH needs injected touch pointers, not injected mouse events.**
This machine has no digitizer (only a precision touchpad), which does not stop
touch being verified on it: `CreateSyntheticPointerDevice(PT_TOUCH, ...)` plus
`InjectSyntheticPointerInput` (both `user32`) produce genuine touch contacts,
WinUI reports them as `PointerDeviceType.Touch`, and the ScrollViewer's direct
manipulation treats them exactly as it treats a finger. Mouse injection cannot
substitute, because DManip is the thing under test and it handles the two
differently. Declare the structs `[StructLayout(Sequential)]` and let the
marshaller compute the layout rather than hand-packing bytes; on x64 the sizes
come out `POINTER_INFO` 96, `POINTER_TOUCH_INFO` 144, `POINTER_TYPE_INFO` 152,
which is worth asserting. Note that PowerShell 5.1's `Add-Type` is a **C# 5**
compiler: no expression-bodied members.

**Verifying UI features** is scripted, not just tested — drive the running
`Rune.exe` with `SetForegroundWindow`/`keybd_event` P/Invoke + `CopyFromScreen`,
then Read the PNG (see §7). The reusable helper used this session lives in the
session scratchpad (`shot.ps1` / `drive-rune.ps1`).

## 7. Environment gotchas (READ before debugging weird failures)

- **Smart App Control (SAC):** if you see `0x800711C7` ("Application Control
  policy has blocked this file") on run/`dotnet test`, SAC has flipped to
  **Enforce** and blocks unsigned locally-built binaries. Check
  `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CI\Policy` →
  `VerifiedAndReputablePolicyState` (0=off, 1=enforce, 2=eval). The user
  turned it **off**; the real fix is code signing. `dotnet build` still works
  under SAC (compile only); running/loading assemblies is what's blocked.
- **CanvasVirtualControl tile cap:** bitmaps wider than ~1.5k px silently fail
  to draw inside a drawing session on this hardware. `MaxSingleTilePx` is
  pinned to **1024** in `Tiles.cs` — do **not** raise it. (This was the root
  cause of the "rotate shows blank page" bug: only rotated landscape pages
  produced tiles that wide.)
- **PDFium text-object landmines** (v0.7.0; see `PdfDocument.Text.cs`):
  - **Set the annotation's rect BEFORE appending objects to it.** PDFium sizes
    the appearance form's bounding box from the rect at the moment an object is
    appended, so appending into a still-empty rect gives a zero-sized box and the
    text renders as *nothing at all* — while every read-back reports exactly what
    was asked for. Setting the rect afterwards does not rebuild it. The stamp
    path always did this in the right order; the text path had to learn it.
  - **FreeText is a dead end.** PDFium generates no appearance for it, and
    `FPDFAnnot_AppendObject` is gated on a subtype check admitting only ink and
    stamp. A FreeText annotation is refused the object and draws nothing. Real
    text goes in a **stamp** annotation.
  - `FPDFTextObj_GetFont` returns the **document's** font, not a loaned one.
    Never pass it to `FPDFFont_Close` — that frees a font the page still draws
    with. Only a font from `FPDFText_LoadStandardFont` is yours to close.
  - `/Contents` on a text stamp is its alt text, which is correct per the spec
    and is what `TryReadTextBox` reads the words from. Edge draws a small comment
    marker beside any annotation that has `/Contents`. That is Edge's choice, it
    is cosmetic, and flattening removes the annotation entirely.
- **A `TextBox` will not go transparent by setting `Background`.** Its template
  swaps in `TextControlBackground*` and `TextControlForeground*` per visual
  state, so both properties lose the moment the box takes focus — which for the
  on-page editor is immediately. Override those keys on the element itself, and
  mutate one brush instance rather than assigning a new one, because the template
  resolves the resource once when it is applied.
- **Do not add `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK` back as a package reference.**
  `Rune.App.csproj` deliberately references the six sub-packages it needs
  (Base, Foundation, InteractiveExperiences, WinUI, DWrite, Runtime) instead.
  The meta-package hard-depends on `.Widgets`, `.AI` and `.ML`, and `.ML` pulls
  in `Microsoft.Windows.AI.MachineLearning` — `onnxruntime.dll` (20.7 MB) plus
  `DirectML.dll` (17.8 MB) in a PDF reader that runs no inference. There is no
  supported opt-out property; the sub-package list is the only route, and none
  of the six depends on AI, ML or Widgets. **Upgrading the SDK means bumping six
  lines and re-reading the meta-package's nuspec** for any newly added
  dependency Rune actually needs. Verify by *launching* the build, not just
  compiling: a missing WinAppSDK binary fails at first XAML load. Night mode is
  the sharpest single check — it goes through Win2D's `InvertEffect`.
- **PDFium form-fill landmines** (all cost real time in v0.5.0; see
  `PdfiumFormEnvironment.cs` and `PdfDocument.Forms.cs`):
  - **`FPDFAnnot_SetFormFieldValue` does not exist.** The only way to change a
    field's value is to drive the event API — click, then `FORM_OnChar`. Don't
    go looking for a programmatic setter; there isn't one.
  - `FPDF_FORMFILLINFO.version` must be **1**. Version 2 appends XFA members and
    this build has no XFA, so declaring 2 makes PDFium read past the struct.
  - PDFium stores the **pointer** to `FPDF_FORMFILLINFO`, so it lives in
    `AllocHGlobal` memory, not on the managed heap where the GC can move it —
    same rule as `FileAccessAdapter`.
  - `FFI_GetLocalTime` is left NULL deliberately: it returns a 16-byte struct
    **by value**, and it's only used by form JS, which this build can't run.
  - `FFI_SetTimer`/`FFI_KillTimer` are left NULL deliberately — they exist for
    caret blink, which would re-rasterize the focused field's tiles twice a
    second. A decision, not an oversight.
  - `FFI_GetPage` must **not** call `FORM_OnAfterLoadPage`, and must not load a
    page — PDFium calls it from inside its own page setup. It returns only pages
    the cache already holds.
  - **Never `RunAsync` from inside a form callback** — instant deadlock.
  - **`FPDF_SetFormFieldHighlightColor` takes BGR, not RGB**, despite the header
    saying `0xxxrrggbb`. Passing `0x3399FF` renders peach. Verified on screen.
  - **Kill form focus before every save.** PDFium holds the in-progress value in
    the focused widget, so saving with focus alive writes the field's *previous*
    value. `SaveAs` and `FlattenPage` both do this themselves.
  - `FPDFImageObj_SetBitmap` takes a page **array**, not a page.
  - `FPDFSignatureObj_GetSubFilter`/`GetTime` are ASCII; `GetReason` is UTF-16.
- **File pickers are brokered out of process, and that broker can just fail.**
  Every `PickSingleFileAsync` spawns a fresh `PickerHost.exe`; when its
  activation fails you get `COMException 0x80004005` (E_FAIL) and no dialog ever
  appears. A real v0.6.0 build hit this three times in a row (§10) and it has
  never reproduced since. Consequences for anything touching a picker: go through
  `Services/FilePickerHost`, which owns `InitializeWithWindow`, retries once and
  logs both attempts; never call a picker from `ContentDialog.Opened`, since that
  fires it from inside the dialog's open transition; and never report a picker
  failure as a problem with the file, because at that point no file was chosen.
- **A `/DA` rewrite does not repaint the widget.** PDFium builds a form widget's
  appearance stream during page setup and caches it, so
  `FPDFAnnot_SetStringValue(annot, "DA", …)` reads back perfectly while the page
  goes on drawing the old appearance. `SetFieldAppearance` therefore evicts the
  page handle afterwards (`EvictPageLocked`), which makes the next acquire re-run
  `FORM_OnAfterLoadPage` and rebuild it. Assert on **pixels**, not on the string:
  this is the same shape as the v0.6.0 stamp resize, where `GetMatrix` agreed
  with what was asked for and the render did not.
- **Theme brushes in code-behind**: never resolve one via
  `Application.Current.Resources["...Brush"]` — it returns the **dark** value
  whatever the active theme is. Define a `Style` in `Styles/Controls.xaml` and
  assign `element.Style`; a Style's setters resolve against the element's real
  theme. Reading a *Style* out of `Application.Current.Resources` is fine.
- **`ContentDialog` doesn't follow `Window.Content`'s theme either.** It is
  hosted in a popup outside the content tree, so it tracks the OS: choosing
  Light in Rune on a dark-mode Windows gave a dark dialog over a light app.
  `ShowDialogAsync` now sets `dialog.RequestedTheme` centrally — every dialog in
  the window goes through it, so don't call `ShowAsync` directly.
- **`InfoBar` stretches to its container.** Its template is a full-width bar, so
  dropping one into the row-2 overlay Grid painted it straight across the
  sidebar with its message clipped. Notices go through `NoticeHost`, which
  bounds it with `MaxWidth` + centre alignment. There are two hosts: one per
  `DocumentView` (inside `SplitView.Content`, so it can never reach the sidebar
  and re-centres itself when the pane toggles — no width arithmetic), and one at
  window level for messages with no document open. `MainWindow.ShowNotice`
  routes between them; `ShowError` is a thin shim over it.
- **Caption buttons don't follow `Window.Content`'s theme.** Because the theme is
  set on the content root rather than `Application.RequestedTheme`, the system
  caption glyphs track the OS. `MainWindow.ApplyThemeToChrome` sets
  `AppWindow.TitleBar.Button*Color` explicitly — and their backgrounds must stay
  `Transparent` or Mica dies behind the tab strip.
- **`ChangeView` clamps against the OLD extent.** After `RebuildLayout()` assigns
  `Canvas.Width/Height`, the ScrollViewer has not re-measured, so `ChangeView`
  clamps the requested offset to the previous `ScrollableWidth/Height` —
  zooming in silently lands short. Call `Scroller.UpdateLayout()` in between
  (see `ScrollToAnchor`). Same class as the stale-`ViewportWidth` note above.
  `ChangeView` also returns `bool` and does nothing when it returns false.
- **Zoom must anchor in PAGE space, never document space.** `PageLayout` is
  affine, not a pure scale: `Margin` and `PageGap` are constant DIPs and pages
  are centred. Scaling a scroll offset by the zoom ratio therefore mis-scales
  those constants, and since the gap is added once per page the error grows
  with page index — barely visible on page 1, tens of DIPs by page 40. Use
  `ZoomAnchor.Capture`/`Restore`; `ZoomAnchorTests` pins the behaviour.
- **Handle Ctrl+wheel on the Canvas, not the ScrollViewer.** Attaching to the
  ScrollViewer needs `handledEventsToo: true`, which means the ScrollViewer has
  *already* applied its own Ctrl+wheel zoom — so the real zoom stepped and its
  `ZoomFactor` got folded in on top, zooming roughly twice as far per notch.
  `PointerWheelChanged` bubbles from the hit-test target, so handling it on the
  child pre-empts the ScrollViewer entirely.
- **A touch contact cannot be taken back from the ScrollViewer once direct
  manipulation has started** (v0.8.0, and the most expensive thing in it). This
  is the rule the whole touch design is built around, and it is not obvious,
  because the routed events keep arriving as though nothing is wrong.
  - **Ownership of a touch gesture has to be decided on the PRESS.** The
    obvious design for select-by-finger is press, wait, and if the finger has
    not moved start selecting. It cannot work. By the time the timer fires,
    DManip has the contact, and it revokes the capture the instant the finger
    travels. The trace is unmistakable and worth recognizing: the anchor lands
    correctly, a dozen stationary moves arrive, then **one** move of about
    three pixels, then `PointerCaptureLost`. On screen it looks like a
    selection exactly one character wide. This is why holding selects a *word*
    (needing no drag) and why widening it is a *separate* press that starts on
    the existing selection, which is something the press handler can test for.
    Selection handles on a phone are the same mechanism with a visible grip.
  - **Disabling the scroll modes is not enough. `ZoomMode` has to go off too.**
    With `HorizontalScrollMode`/`VerticalScrollMode` off the page correctly
    refuses to pan, and it still fails, because DManip goes on watching the
    contact in case it becomes a pinch and takes the capture anyway. Both
    `BeginExclusiveGesture` and `EndExclusiveGesture` therefore move all three.
  - **Capturing a touch pointer stops the ScrollViewer panning**, which is the
    bug this all started from: `BeginSelection` captured on any press that hit a
    glyph, and on a page of prose nearly every pixel is a glyph.
  - **Handle `PointerCanceled` and `PointerCaptureLost`.** On touch, losing a
    gesture is routine rather than exceptional. Every drag flag used to be
    cleared only in `PointerReleased`, so a stolen contact left the viewer
    mid-drag with panning still switched off. `SignaturePad` had always wired
    both; the viewer had not.
  - `HoldingRoutedEventArgs` carries **no `Pointer`**, so nothing can be
    captured from the `Holding` event even if you want to. Rune times its own
    hold from `PointerPressed` instead.
  - **Verifying any of this needs real touch pointers.** Injected mouse events
    prove nothing here, because DManip treats them differently. See §6.
- **Win2D controls don't work inside a `ContentDialog`.** A `CanvasControl`
  hosted in the dialog's popup never gets a device and silently renders
  nothing — the signature pad draws with XAML `Polyline`s and uses Win2D only
  offscreen (`CanvasRenderTarget` + `CanvasDevice.GetSharedDevice()`), which is
  unaffected. `InkCanvas` is not available in this SDK at all.
- **Win2D renders premultiplied; PDFium composites straight alpha.** Pinned by
  `StampTests.HalfAlphaGrey_CompositesAsStraightAlpha` — a mid-grey at 50% must
  land at ~191 over white, not ~255. `SignaturePad.ToStraightAlpha` is the one
  place the conversion happens; a fully transparent or fully opaque pixel is
  identical either way, which is why the earlier transparency test couldn't
  detect the difference.
- **`BitmapTransform.ScaledWidth` is in STORED space; the buffer arrives in
  ORIENTED space.** Measured against a 1600x1200 JPEG carrying EXIF orientation
  6 (so it displays 1200x1600): asking for `ScaledWidth=1024, ScaledHeight=768`
  alongside `ExifOrientationMode.RespectExifOrientation` returns an upright
  **768x1024** buffer. So scale off `decoder.PixelWidth/PixelHeight`, then
  transpose the *requested* numbers to describe the result — never scale
  `OrientedPixelWidth/Height` separately, and never report `PixelWidth` as the
  buffer's width (that was a real bug: a portrait phone photo stamped as a
  diagonal smear). Both orderings yield byte-identical buffer *lengths*, so no
  assertion can catch getting this wrong; only looking at the pixels can.
  `SignatureStore.DecodeAsync` is the one place this is handled.
- **`BitmapDecoder.CreateAsync` throws a bare `COMException` on a bad file** —
  not `ArgumentException`. A renamed `.pdf` reaches it as a WIC HRESULT, and
  since the import handler is `async void`, a filtered catch there takes the
  whole process down. `SignatureStore` catches everything and logs.
- **Direct2D refuses straight-alpha bitmaps.** `CanvasBitmap.CreateFromBytes(...,
  CanvasAlphaMode.Straight)` throws `COMException 0x88982F80`
  (`WINCODEC_ERR_UNSUPPORTEDPIXELFORMAT`) — D2D only draws PREMULTIPLIED (or
  ignored) alpha. This shipped in the signature hover preview and made it draw
  **nothing at all**: the throw escaped `DrawSignatureGhost` and took the dashed
  outline down with it, so the whole preview vanished instead of degrading. Rune
  holds signature pixels as straight alpha because that is what PDFium
  composites, so anything handing them to Win2D must go through
  `SignatureMatte.ToPremultiplied` first. A draw path that builds a bitmap
  should also keep that build in its own try/catch, so a bad buffer costs the
  bitmap and not the rest of the frame.
- **No Visual Studio** — everything is `dotnet` CLI. Don't suggest VS-only flows.
- **Line endings:** commits warn `LF will be replaced by CRLF` (harmless);
  `.gitattributes` marks PDFs/images binary so autocrlf can't corrupt them.
- **UI automation for verification** (no computer-use MCP needed): drive Rune
  with `SetForegroundWindow` + `SetCursorPos` + `mouse_event`/`keybd_event`
  via `Add-Type` P/Invoke, screenshot with `CopyFromScreen`, then Read the
  PNG. Two rules: (1) drags need **relative `MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE` deltas**
  (SetCursorPos while a button is held delivers no move); (2) `SetProcessDpiAwareness(2)`
  and remember the display is **125% scale**. Caveat: if another app holds the
  foreground (e.g. a browser/video), input lands there and screenshots capture
  it — verify only when Rune can take focus.
- **Clean screenshots** (no taskbar/desktop bleed): size the window to exactly
  1920×1080 at (0,0) with `SetWindowPos`, then capture with
  `PrintWindow(hwnd, hdc, PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT=2)` — that grabs the window's own
  pixels, so nothing on top can intrude. In-app `Flyout`s (e.g. the pen panel)
  *are* captured; a `MenuFlyout` shown via `ShowAt(element, point)` may render in
  its own HWND and **not** appear — screen-capture those instead.
  **It returns a solid black bitmap if called before the window has finished its
  first composition** — wait for the app to actually draw rather than shooting a
  second after launch. Black output means "too early", not "unsupported"; that
  misreading cost a session's worth of confusion. `CopyFromScreen` is the
  fallback for flyouts, but it cannot produce a clean 1920×1080 on a 1080-tall
  display, because the taskbar overlays the bottom edge even for a topmost window.
- **`ScrollViewer.ViewportWidth` is STALE inside `SizeChanged`.** A ScrollViewer
  refreshes it during its own arrange pass, which runs *after* the event. Reading
  it there lays the document out against the previous size. Use
  `SizeChangedEventArgs.NewSize`. (This was the sidebar-toggle bug: page pinned
  left with ghost strips of the old render.)
- **Never read theme brushes via `Application.Current.Resources["..."]` in code.**
  It returns the **dark-theme** value regardless of the active theme, so e.g.
  `TextFillColorPrimaryBrush` rendered white-on-white in light mode. Use
  `{ThemeResource}` in XAML, or build an explicit `SolidColorBrush`.
- **`ToggleButton.IsChecked` is `bool?`; `ToggleMenuFlyoutItem.IsChecked` is `bool`.**
  Chained assignment across the two won't compile — assign separately.
- **`RuntimeIdentifier` must follow `$(Platform)`.** Pinning it to `win-x64`
  breaks the ARM64 leg of a multi-arch Store bundle (`NETSDK1032`); both RIDs
  must also be in `RuntimeIdentifiers` so restore can resolve them.
- **Symbol packages need `mspdbcmf.exe`** from the VS C++ workload (not installed
  here) — `AppxSymbolPackageEnabled=false`. They're optional for the Store.
- **`WindowsAppSDKSelfContained` and `SelfContained` are DIFFERENT PROPERTIES.**
  The first bundles the Windows App SDK, the second bundles the **.NET runtime**.
  Having only the first shipped every Store package from v0.4.1 to v0.7.0 with no
  runtime in it, so first launch showed Windows' "you must install .NET" download
  dialog. It hid for four releases because the two build paths disagreed and only
  one of them was ever tested locally: the portable zip is `dotnet publish` with
  the self-contained flag **on the command line** and worked; the MSIX is
  `dotnet build`, which passed nothing. Both properties now live in the csproj so
  neither path can carry it alone, and `tools/check-package.ps1` asserts the
  runtime is actually inside the built package.
  **A dev machine cannot reproduce this** — it has the runtime, so the app starts
  either way. The evidence is the artifact: a self-contained package contains
  `hostfxr.dll` / `coreclr.dll` / `System.Private.CoreLib.dll`, and its
  `Rune.runtimeconfig.json` says `includedFrameworks` rather than `framework`.
- **`--` cannot appear inside an XML comment**, so a csproj comment cannot spell
  the self-contained flag with its dashes (`MSB4025`, and the message names the
  line but not the reason).
- **A `.ps1` with no BOM is read as ANSI by Windows PowerShell 5.1.** A UTF-8 em
  dash then arrives as three CP1252 characters ending in a smart quote, which
  opens a string and swallows the rest of the file. The parse error points at a
  brace forty lines further down. Keep repo scripts ASCII.
- **PowerShell + `git commit -m "..."`**: quotes/apostrophes inside the message
  break argument parsing and scatter the body across `pathspec` errors. Write the
  message to a file and use `git commit -F <file>`.
- **Editing files containing private-use glyph chars** (e.g. `FontIcon Glyph=""`
  in `MainWindow.xaml.cs`): exact-string edits spanning those lines fail to match.
  Edit around them, or splice by line range.
- **Focus traps** (see §10 known bugs): the Win2D canvas is not focusable, so
  clicking the page never returns focus. If focus sits on the tab strip or the
  page-number box, navigation keys are dead. When scripting, navigate via the
  command palette (Ctrl+K → type a number → Enter) rather than PageDown.

## 8. Release process

**The Microsoft Store is the install path Rune promotes** (§8b). GitHub Releases
carry **one artifact — the portable zip** — for people who want Rune without the
Store. As of v0.5.0 the sideloaded MSIX and its self-signed certificate are no
longer published: the cert obliged every user to run an admin PowerShell command
to trust a certificate, which is a worse security ask than the Store's
Microsoft-signed package solves for free.

```powershell
# Portable zip — the only GitHub artifact
dotnet publish src/Rune.App/Rune.App.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained `
  -p:Platform=x64 -p:WindowsPackageType=None
Compress-Archive <publish>\* artifacts/rune-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip

gh release create vX.Y.Z <zip> --title "Rune vX.Y.Z" --notes-file notes.md
```

- The `--self-contained` above is now **belt and braces**: `<SelfContained>` is
  set in the csproj (§7), which is what actually does the work and what the MSIX
  path depends on. Leaving it on the command line costs nothing and documents
  the intent at the point someone reads it.
- **Version bump:** `<Version>` in `Rune.App.csproj` **and** `Version=` in
  `Package.appxmanifest`.
- The portable zip is **unsigned**, so SAC/SmartScreen apply to it — documented
  honestly in the README. Signing it is still open (§11).
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs build + test on `windows-latest`, with
  `permissions: contents: read`.
- **Always confirm with the user before anything goes public** (repo/release).
- Compliance: `LICENSE` (GPLv3) + `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` +
  `third_party/WindowsAppSDK-NOTICE.txt` ship inside every binary (PDFium's
  BSD/Apache terms require its license to accompany the DLL).

## 8b. Microsoft Store

Listed as **"Rune PDF Reader"** ("Rune" alone was taken — and is poor Store SEO
anyway; nobody searching "rune" wants a PDF reader). The package identity, exe,
repo and icon all stay `Rune`; only the display name differs.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Identity/Name | `Danimite.RunePDFReader` |
| Identity/Publisher | `CN=513DE1BC-C862-44F8-AEAD-F60E359F4BBF` |
| PublisherDisplayName | `Danimite` |
| Partner Center | developer name **Danimite** (sign in with the account that reserved the name) |

These must match Partner Center **exactly** or the upload is rejected. The
bundle is uploaded unsigned — the Store re-signs it, which is why Store installs
get no SmartScreen/SAC warning.

**Product ID `9NH37840QDM6`** — live at https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NH37840QDM6

**winget works, and needed no work.** The listing is mapped into the `msstore`
source, so `winget install --id 9NH37840QDM6 --source msstore --exact` installs
the same Microsoft-signed package. Verified with `winget show --id 9NH37840QDM6
--source msstore` (v0.6.0 prep). The community `winget-pkgs` route was never
viable: it wants a downloadable installer URL, which Store-only distribution
doesn't provide.

`winget show` also reads back the **live** Store description, which makes it a
free way to check that what Partner Center actually serves matches
`docs/store-listing.md`.

```powershell
# Store upload bundle (unsigned — the Store signs it), x64 + ARM64
dotnet restore src/Rune.App/Rune.App.csproj
dotnet build src/Rune.App/Rune.App.csproj -c Release -p:Platform=x64 `
  -p:WindowsPackageType=MSIX -p:GenerateAppxPackageOnBuild=true `
  -p:AppxPackageSigningEnabled=false `
  -p:AppxBundle=Always -p:AppxBundlePlatforms="x64|arm64" `
  -p:UapAppxPackageBuildMode=StoreUpload `
  -p:AppxPackageDir="..\..\artifacts\store\"
# → artifacts/store/Rune.App_X.Y.Z.0_x64_arm64_bundle.msixupload  (~135 MB)

# REQUIRED before uploading: does the package actually contain a .NET runtime?
tools\check-package.ps1 artifacts\store\Rune.App_X.Y.Z.0_x64_arm64_bundle.msixupload
```

- **Run the check every time.** A package with no runtime builds, uploads and
  certifies without complaint, and only fails on a machine that isn't yours —
  which is how v0.4.1 through v0.7.0 shipped that way (§7, §10). The check walks
  the nested zips and fails unless every package carrying an executable also
  carries `hostfxr.dll`, `coreclr.dll` and `System.Private.CoreLib.dll`. The
  `scale-*` resource packages hold images and no code, and are skipped.
  It was verified in both directions when it was written: `FAIL` against the
  v0.6.0 bundle that actually shipped, `OK` against v0.8.0. `artifacts/` is
  gitignored, so any pre-v0.8.0 `.msixupload` you still have locally is the
  known-bad sample to re-test the check against if you change it.

- **Rune contains no networking code, and must not gain any.** `UpdateService`
  was deleted in v0.5.0. That is what lets the privacy declaration and the
  `runFullTrust` justification both say "makes no network connections, collects
  no data" *unconditionally* — previously the claim held only because the
  updater was gated off for packaged builds. Adding a network call back
  invalidates both, and pointing a Store user at a download outside the Store is
  a certification failure on its own.
- `runFullTrust` is flagged at submission as a restricted capability needing
  approval. Expected for every WinUI 3 desktop app; justification text is in
  `docs/store-listing.md`.
- `PRIVACY.md` must be live on `main` before submitting — certification follows
  the URL in the listing.
- Store screenshots must use a **licence-safe** document (they're published
  commercially). The current set uses the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook —
  a US Government work, so public domain. **Never** shoot the user's own files;
  filenames leak in the tab strip and recents list.

## 9. Version history

- **v0.8.0** (2026-08-18) — the Store build finally ships a runtime, text
  boxes become text boxes.
  **Fixed, and the most important thing in the release: every Store install
  since v0.4.1 asked the user to download .NET on first launch.** The package
  genuinely had no runtime in it. `WindowsAppSDKSelfContained` was set, which
  bundles the Windows App SDK; `SelfContained`, which bundles the .NET runtime,
  never was. The portable zip escaped it because its `dotnet publish` line
  carries the flag explicitly, and the portable zip is the build anyone tests
  locally — the MSIX is a plain `dotnet build` that passed nothing. Nothing in
  the build, the upload or certification notices, and a dev machine cannot
  reproduce it, because a dev machine has the runtime. The property now lives in
  the csproj where both paths get it, `tools/check-package.ps1` asserts the
  runtime is in the artifact, and §8b makes running it a required step before
  upload. The bundle roughly doubles to ~135 MB, which is where it was at v0.4.1
  before the ML runtime came out.
  **Fixed: the text-box chords were reaching the document.** `Ctrl+B` bookmarked
  the page while you were trying to embolden a word, `Ctrl+I` flipped the whole
  document to night mode, `Ctrl+E` armed the pen and `Ctrl+R` rotated the page.
  `AddAccelerator` now takes the document, text-box and form-field meanings of a
  chord side by side and resolves them in that order, so `Esc` hands every one
  of them straight back.
  **Fixed: resizing a text box resized the words.** A box now has a **width**;
  the corner drag sets it and the words re-flow at the point size you chose,
  with the height falling out of the wrap. That is also what made alignment mean
  anything, so `Ctrl+L/E/R/J` and `Ctrl+U` arrived with it — underline as a
  filled rectangle path per line, justify as one text object per word, and both
  plus the width stored in a private `/RuneStyle` key because PDF has nowhere
  standard to put them on a stamp.
  **Fixed: the wheel was backwards while placing a picture.** Plain wheel
  resized the ghost and `Ctrl`+wheel zoomed, so you could not scroll to the spot
  you wanted to drop it on. Now the plain wheel scrolls and `Ctrl`+wheel sizes.
  **Added: Share**, to any app on the Windows share sheet, through
  `DataTransferManagerInterop` for the same reason printing uses
  `PrintManagerInterop`. Unsaved edits go out as a copy under the document's own
  name; the original is never written to. The first thing in Rune that hands a
  document to anything else, and PRIVACY.md says so.
  **Added: document properties worth opening.** Sectioned, with blanks shown as
  blanks — a missing Author row could not be told apart from one nobody looked
  for. Dates parsed out of PDF's `D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSS` syntax, page size named,
  permissions spelled out, and the font list filled in after the dialog opens so
  `Ctrl+D` never waits on a page walk.
  **Added: the app takes a finger.** Nothing in it had ever asked what kind of
  pointer was touching it, and the cost was not a rough edge but the reading
  half of the app: a press on a glyph captured the pointer, capturing a touch
  contact stops the ScrollViewer panning, and on a page of prose nearly every
  pixel is a glyph, so **the document could not be scrolled at all**. A plain
  touch drag is now always a scroll. A hold takes the word under the finger and
  the lift offers the markup menu, so highlight, underline, strikeout and copy
  stop being mouse-only; a second press landing on that selection drags it
  wider. Form fields raise the soft keyboard through `InputPaneInterop`, which
  they could not do on their own because a PDF widget is pixels PDFium drew
  rather than a XAML text input. Hit slop, a 24 DIP reach on the corner handles,
  palm rejection for ink, a second tap to put a tool away, and touch routes for
  delete, bookmark, the palette and going back in presentation. All of it is
  zero or unchanged for a mouse, which `TouchMetrics` pins by test.
  The lesson worth keeping is in §7: **a touch contact cannot be reclaimed from
  direct manipulation once it has started**, so ownership has to be decided on
  the press, and turning off the scroll modes is not enough on its own because
  DManip keeps watching the contact for a pinch. Both cost a rebuild-and-look
  cycle each, and both present as the app ignoring input when it is not.
  Also found on the way: `FPDF_PAGEOBJ_FORM` is **5**, not 6. The wrong constant
  fails silently — the type check simply never matches and every form XObject on
  the page is walked past, which is why the font scan reported nothing for
  flattened text.

- **v0.7.0** (2026-08-10) — put a word, or a picture, anywhere on a page.
  **Added: the text tool.** Arm it (`Ctrl+T`), click any part of any page whether
  or not there is anything there, and a box opens with a caret in it. A bar
  floats over the page offering font, size, bold, italic and colour, and every
  change lands on the words immediately. Esc or a click elsewhere commits; an
  empty box is dropped without leaving an annotation, a dirty marker or anything
  on the undo stack.
  The text is **real text**, which was the open question this release had to
  settle. PDFium generates no appearance for a FreeText annotation, and
  `FPDFAnnot_AppendObject` admits only ink and stamp subtypes, so FreeText is
  refused the object and renders as nothing. As a *stamp* annotation carrying
  text objects it works, stays a discrete object the existing move/erase/undo
  machinery already handles, and flattens into ordinary searchable page text.
  Nothing in the path carries font metrics: the lines are laid out around an
  arbitrary origin, measured with `FPDFPageObj_GetBounds`, and moved as a block,
  so the box is whatever PDFium will actually draw and cannot drift from it.
  **Added: place a picture.** Any PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF or TIFF, through the same
  arm → hover ghost → click-or-drag → `AddStamp` pipeline a signature uses; only
  the source was ever signature-specific, so `PdfViewer.Signature.cs` became
  `PdfViewer.StampPlacement.cs` and the placement carries a label ("signature" or
  "image") for its undo entry rather than the shell keeping a parallel state
  machine. No matting: `SignatureMatte` exists to remove paper from a
  photographed signature, and a picture the user deliberately chose should land
  as it is. An image arms at its natural size capped to half the page, because a
  1024px photo at 96dpi is 768pt and wider than the paper.
  **Added: one selection model.** Selection used to be signature-only in
  practice. A text box *was* selectable and draggable, but `CommitStampResize`
  went through `ResizeStamp`, which begins by reading the stamp's pixels back —
  a text annotation has none, so the corner drag silently snapped back and the
  handles did nothing. Both kinds now share select/move/delete, and differ only
  in the resize: a picture is rescaled, **text is re-rendered at a new point
  size**. That is the whole reason for storing text as text, and it is why a text
  box resizes aspect-locked rather than by width: Rune does no line wrapping, so
  the words break where the user broke them and the two axes have to move
  together.
  Resizing text needs the style back out of the file, and it is read rather than
  cached, for the same reason `TryReadStampImage` exists: a cache would refuse to
  resize a box that was already in the document when it opened, and annotation
  indexes shift underneath one anyway. The words come from `/Contents`, the size
  from `FPDFTextObj_GetFontSize`, the face from `FPDFTextObj_GetFont` +
  `FPDFFont_GetBaseFontName`, and the colour from `FPDFPageObj_GetFillColor`.
  `TextBoxContent.TryParsePostScriptName` is written by generating all twelve
  standard-14 names and comparing, so the two directions cannot drift.
  **Fixed: erasing a signature could not be undone.** `CaptureAnnotation`
  returned null for subtype 13, so the eraser raised no undo entry at all and
  Ctrl+Z did nothing. It was easy to miss while stamps were rare; it would not
  have been once text and pictures were stamps too. `AnnotationSpec` already
  carried both pixels and words and `AddAnnotationFromSpec` already rebuilt both,
  so the fix was to admit the subtype and fill whichever applies. The eraser's
  *redo* was wrong too: undo re-adds by appending, so redo has to remove the last
  annotation rather than the index the erase originally hit.
  **Fixed: switching tabs stopped a view rendering, permanently.** `PdfViewer`
  disposed its `RenderScheduler` on `Unloaded`, and a `TabView` unloads the
  content of a tab you switch away from — which is not going away at all. The
  render thread never came back, and nothing recreated it. It looked fine for a
  while, which is what hid it: the tiles and thumbnails already rendered stayed
  cached and were still drawn. The page only went white when something
  invalidated them, and then stayed white for good. Two tabs, switch across and
  back, press `Ctrl+R`: page and thumbnails both blank. The scheduler is now
  recreated on `Loaded`, and `UpdateDesiredTiles` no longer answers a zero-area
  viewport by asking for nothing (which is indistinguishable from being told to
  render nothing, and equally permanent).
  **Fixed: backspace did nothing in a form field, and nothing could be
  selected.** Four separate causes behind one report, each confirmed by probe
  before anything was changed:
  - **Backspace** was sent through `FORM_OnKeyDown`, which **refuses it** and
    returns false. PDFium's edit control handles Delete and the arrows in its key
    handler but backspace in its *character* handler, so it has to go through
    `FORM_OnChar` as character 8. Delete worked, which is exactly what made this
    look like a dead key rather than a routing mistake.
  - **Shift+arrow** passed no modifier, so PDFium moved the caret and selected
    nothing. `FWL_EVENTFLAG_ShiftKey` is what turns one into the other.
  - **Dragging** could not select, because a click was a button-down and a
    button-up at the same point with nothing between. PDFium's edit control
    starts a selection on the down and extends it on each *move*, so the viewer
    now sends a real press, moves and release, with the pointer captured.
  - **Ctrl+A** was not routed at all, and is another character-handler case:
    `FORM_OnKeyDown(A, ctrl)` is refused, `FORM_OnChar(1, ctrl)` selects all.

  Backspace is routed from `KeyDown` rather than from `CharacterReceived`
  deliberately: KeyDown certainly fires for it, and `TryHandleFormCharacter`
  drops control characters, so it cannot delete twice however the events arrive.
  **Fixed: `Ctrl+T` was promised and not wired.** The text button's tooltip named
  it, no accelerator existed, and neither the text nor the picture tool appeared
  in the command palette or `ShortcutCatalog`.
  334 → 366 tests.

- **v0.6.0** (2026-08-09) — the release that stops the reader disabling itself.
  **Fixed: rotating the page no longer turns half the app off.** Text selection,
  annotation, links, form filling and the whole signature flow all early-returned
  on `_rotation != 0` — fourteen guards across five files, with nothing on screen
  to say why. The cause was two helpers: `ToPageLocal` undid the centring offset
  and the zoom, which lands in the *drawn* box, while every consumer (`PageText`
  char boxes, form field rects, annotation rects, the x/y `AddStamp` takes) is
  measured in unrotated page points; `HighlightRect` had the inverse assumption.
  On a quarter turn those two spaces have the page's axes swapped, so rather than
  return a point on the wrong part of the page, each caller switched itself off.
  New `PageRotationTransform` maps between them and the guards are gone. It is
  managed arithmetic rather than `FPDF_DeviceToPage` on purpose — pointer moves
  hit it per event, and v0.4.0 moved hit-testing off PDFium precisely to stop that
  freezing the UI thread. Two paths needed more than the guard removed: form
  field borders now go through the same rotation PDFium's own widget fill gets,
  and a signature placed while rotated has its pixels turned the other way first
  (`SignatureMatte.RotateQuarterTurns`) so it reads upright against the content
  the user was looking at rather than against the file's axes.
  `Rotate()` also stopped discarding the user's work: it cleared selection,
  search hits, links and the page-text cache on every turn because none of it
  could be placed once rotated. All four are in unrotated page coordinates and
  therefore rotation-independent, so find a hit, rotate, and the hit is still
  there. Tiles and previews are still dropped — those really are per-rotation,
  and that invalidation is the v0.2 blank-page fix.
  **Added: page extract.** `ExportPages` already returned a selection as PDF
  bytes (it backs the page clipboard), so extract needed no engine work: a
  thumbnail context-menu entry, a palette entry, and a save picker. Extracting
  over the open document is refused rather than pulling the file out from under
  the read handle.
  **Added: resizing a placed signature**, with aspect-locked corner handles.
  This was attempted, backed out, and then solved from the other end, which is
  worth recording. Editing the appearance in place —
  `FPDFPageObj_SetMatrix` plus `FPDFAnnot_UpdateObject` — is exact once and then
  compounds: `UpdateObject` re-serializes the appearance while keeping the old
  `/BBox`, PDFium maps that BBox onto the annotation rect, and so growing a stamp
  and shrinking it back drew it at half the size asked for, with `GetMatrix`
  reading back correct all the while. Clearing the appearance first to reset the
  BBox destroys its objects. What broke the deadlock was disproving the premise
  in the old roadmap note: PDFium *will* hand a stamp's pixels back, through
  `FPDFImageObj_GetRenderedBitmap`, straight-alpha and intact after a save and
  reopen. So `ResizeStamp` reads the pixels, removes the annotation and re-creates
  it through `AddStamp`, which builds a fresh appearance every time and therefore
  cannot accumulate. It also works on a signature that was already in the file,
  which a session-side pixel cache never would have.
  **Added: typed signatures**, the third input mode beside draw and import. No
  font is bundled — Segoe Script, Segoe Print and Ink Free ship with Windows, and
  bundling one would undo part of the size work below. `SignatureFonts` resolves
  each style against the installed set and feeds the same answer to the preview
  and the render, so they cannot disagree; when nothing resolves the pad disables
  the field and says why instead of quietly producing something that looks typed.
  Cropping uses DirectWrite's `DrawBounds` rather than the layout box, because a
  script face overhangs its box on both sides.
  **Removed 19 MB from the zip (88 → 69 MB).** The `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK`
  meta-package hard-depends on `.Widgets`, `.AI` and `.ML`, and `.ML` pulls in
  `Microsoft.Windows.AI.MachineLearning`: `onnxruntime.dll` (20.7 MB) plus
  `DirectML.dll` (17.8 MB) inside a PDF reader that runs no inference. There is no
  opt-out property, so `Rune.App.csproj` now references the six sub-packages Rune
  actually needs. Size was the smaller half of the reason: an OAuth component and
  an ML runtime sitting in a package whose Store listing and `runFullTrust`
  justification both say "no network connections, collects no data" is a fair
  question, and "the meta-package put it there" is not much of an answer. See §7
  before touching it again.
  **Security:** PDFium 152.0.7961 → **153.0.7988**, a full Chrome milestone of PDF
  fixes. `SECURITY.md` added, pointing exploitable bugs at private vulnerability
  reporting and drawing the line between a PDFium parser bug (Chromium's tracker)
  and Rune's own code.
  **Added: "Report a problem…"** in the menu — version, Store or portable,
  Windows build, and where the log is. `ErrorLog` had been writing to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Rune` from eleven call sites since v0.4.1 with nothing in the
  app saying so, and with no telemetry by design that is the only route a crash
  reaches anyone. Issue templates ask for the same details up front.
  **Fixed: the file picker, and everything that reaches one.** A real v0.6.0
  build logged three `COMException 0x80004005` in a row out of
  `SignaturePad.ImportAsync`, all from `PickSingleFileAsync` itself. The import
  code turned out to be byte-identical to v0.5.1, where the same path
  demonstrably worked, so the fault was never in it — Windows 11 brokers these
  pickers into a fresh `PickerHost.exe` per call and a failed activation looks
  exactly like this. It never reproduced (§10 lists everything that was tried),
  so the answer is resilience rather than a logic change. `FilePickerHost` now
  owns every picker in the app: the owner window, one retry, both attempts
  logged, and a result that tells picked from cancelled from failed. Four of the
  five call sites — Open, Save As, Extract, Insert pages — previously ran a
  picker inside `async void` reach with no `try` at all, which is the shape that
  killed the process in v0.4.1. The signature import also stopped firing its
  picker from `ContentDialog.Opened`: it picks first and builds the pad around
  the answer, which removes the race, stops an empty pad flashing behind the
  picker, and means cancelling leaves nothing to dismiss. And a picker that never
  opened no longer reports "that image couldn't be read", which had sent the
  person who hit it looking at their photo instead of at Windows.
  **Added: colour and size for form-filling text**, the last roadmap item that
  was not blocked by something external. The setting lives in the widget's `/DA`
  string; `DefaultAppearance` reads and rewrites it while keeping the font
  resource name the file already uses, because that name is a key into the
  AcroForm `/DR` and inventing one renders the field in no font at all. Writing
  the string was the easy half: PDFium caches a widget's appearance stream, so
  the `/DA` read back perfectly while the page went on drawing the old one.
  Evicting the page handle afterwards makes the next acquire re-run
  `FORM_OnAfterLoadPage` and rebuild it. The tests count pixels rather than
  reading the string back — including after a save and reopen — because that is
  the only assertion that can tell those two apart.
  **Also:** winget turned out to already work through the `msstore` source, so it
  needed a README line and not a project; `MaxVersionTested` was two Windows
  builds behind. 244 → 326 tests.
- **v0.5.1** (2026-08-08) — signature import that actually works on a photo.
  **Added:** `SignatureMatte`, an adaptive local matte that keys the paper out
  of a photographed or scanned signature automatically — tiled 90th-percentile
  paper estimate with ink-tile refill, a data-driven ink level (which is what
  removes the need for a sensitivity slider), alpha unmixing so soft edges stay
  faithful, and an alpha-sum crop. One "Remove background" checkbox, on by
  default, auto-unticked for a source that already has transparency. Imports are
  downscaled at decode time to `TileMath.MaxSingleTilePx`.
  **Fixed:** three real bugs on that path — `BitmapDecoder.CreateAsync` throws a
  bare `COMException` for an unreadable file and, through an `async void`
  handler, killed the process; `SignatureStore` reported `PixelWidth` for an
  EXIF-rotated photo, which stamped a portrait phone shot as a diagonal smear;
  and full-resolution buffers silently broke the on-page hover ghost.
  **Also fixed:** the hover ghost had *never* rendered — it asked Win2D for
  `CanvasAlphaMode.Straight`, which Direct2D rejects outright
  (`WINCODEC_ERR_UNSUPPORTEDPIXELFORMAT`), and the throw took the dashed outline
  down with it so the preview vanished instead of degrading. 209 → 244 tests.
- **v0.1.0** — viewer core: tabs-in-titlebar, thumbnails/outline sidebar,
  links, text selection, search, night mode, print, command palette, session
  restore. (Built as milestones M0–M6.)
- **v0.2.0** (2026-07-14) — markup annotations (highlight/underline/strikeout)
  + sticky notes, Save/Save As, self-updater, pinch/Ctrl-wheel zoom. Also
  fixed three bugs: night mode (dead after the titlebar refactor), zoom
  gestures (never wired), rotate (blank pages from the tile-width bug).
- **v0.3.0** (2026-07-19) — freehand **ink** annotations; toolbar rebuilt as a
  stock **CommandBar** (Notepad pattern, hidden on start page); **recent-docs
  thumbnail homepage**; fixed the far-zoom-out **black box** (PageLayout
  min-viewport-height + vertical centering) and the stray **"Ctrl++" tooltip**
  (`KeyboardAcceleratorPlacementMode=Hidden`).
- **v0.4.0** (2026-07-20) — big smoothness + UX release.
  **Fixed:** the random freezes (all PDFium work moved off the UI thread onto
  the render thread's priority op queue; selection hit-tests now pure managed
  lookups via `PageText`; scroll recompute coalesced; night-mode effect
  cached); the "page stuck to the left on open" bug (fit deferred until the
  viewport is measured, no more 800×600 fallback). **Added:** always-on
  arrow/PageUp/Home-End navigation; a **GNOME-Papers-style redesign** (slim
  header + hamburger, floating zoom pill, redesigned sidebar with
  thumbnails/chapters/bookmarks switcher, clean recents grid, centralized
  tokens/styles); **presentation mode** (F5); **shortcuts overlay** (F1);
  **user bookmarks** (Ctrl+B); **page editing** (reorder/delete/clipboard/
  insert incl. cross-tab and external-PDF drop); **undo/redo** (Ctrl+Z/Y) over
  annotations + page ops. 50 → 93 tests.
- **v0.4.1** (2026-07-29) — bug-fix release from user testing of v0.4.0.
  **Fixed:** the **crash on "check for updates" with a document open**. There
  was no `Application.UnhandledException` handler anywhere, so a second
  concurrent `ContentDialog` (WinUI allows one) threw out of an `async void`
  and killed the process. Two paths produced it: the Settings "check now"
  button lives *inside* the Settings dialog, and the startup check could
  collide with a user-initiated one — the latter is why a document had to be
  open (restoring one delays the startup check into collision range). Added
  `ErrorLog` + app-level `UnhandledException`/`UnobservedTaskException`
  handlers, `DialogHost` (serializes all 10 dialog sites), a single-flight
  update guard, and a never-throws contract on `DownloadAndApplyAsync`.
  Self-update no longer discards unsaved annotations (it prompts *before*
  downloading), and the releases-page fallback no longer opens the browser
  when you click Cancel.
  **Fixed:** thumbnails **not matching page shape** — a fixed-width box with
  only a `MinHeight` letterboxed every landscape/4:3/16:9 page, invisibly
  (hardcoded white bars behind white slides). Boxes now take each page's own
  aspect ratio, sized *before* the render arrives (so the list no longer
  reflows mid-scroll), follow Ctrl+R, and are theme-aware; homepage cards get
  a bordered, correctly-shaped page box.
  **Added:** pen colour/width panel **on the pen button** (clicking keeps
  drawing on and re-opens it; Esc / Ctrl+E / "Stop drawing" exit), and
  **fit-width / fit-page / rotate-left / rotate-right always visible in the
  header** (+ Ctrl+Shift+R for rotate-left). 93 → 118 tests. Also: `main` is
  now branch-protected (no force-push, no deletion).
- **v0.5.0** (2026-07-31) — the release that turns a reader into a document tool.
  **Added: interactive form filling.** The whole of `fpdf_formfill.h` was
  unbound; v0.5.0 adds the form-fill environment (`PdfiumFormEnvironment`), the
  `FPDF_FFLDraw` pass inside `RenderRegionToBuffer` (so filled fields show in
  tiles, thumbnails, presentation and print alike), pointer/keyboard routing,
  and XFA detection with an honest info bar instead of a dead form.
  **Added: flatten** (`FPDFPage_Flatten`) and **signature details** — read-only,
  reporting only what the file claims plus `/ByteRange` coverage, and never
  asserting validity, because Rune ships no cryptography.
  **New architecture: the page-handle cache** (`PdfDocument.PageCache.cs`) —
  PDFium needs a stable `FPDF_PAGE` across keystrokes, so pages are no longer
  loaded and closed per operation. Every PDFium call site was moved onto it, and
  the last seven off-render-thread call sites (including `PrintService`, which
  rendered on the *UI* thread) now go through the work queue.
  **Fixed** all three v0.4.1 known bugs (see §10), plus the two
  `Application.Current.Resources` brush reads and caption buttons that ignored
  the app's theme. Colour now lives in `Styles/RuneColors.cs` (Win2D) and
  `{ThemeResource}` brushes (XAML); ~20 hardcoded `Opacity` values became real
  secondary/tertiary text brushes.
  **New logo**: the raido rune set on a document page, authored as
  `assets/rune.svg` and rasterized by `tools/gen-icon.ps1` through WPF — plus
  the full scale-100..400 asset set the Store recommends, where before there was
  only scale-200.
  **Fixed two long-standing viewer bugs** found by using the build:
  *Zoom didn't follow the cursor* — both zoom paths scaled the scroll offset by
  the zoom ratio, which assumes document space scales purely with zoom. It
  doesn't (constant `Margin`/`PageGap`, centred pages), and the error compounded
  once per page gap: negligible on page 1, tens of DIPs by page 40. Anchoring
  now goes through `ZoomAnchor` in page space. Ctrl+wheel is also handled
  directly on the Canvas instead of by the ScrollViewer, so it anchors exactly
  and never raster-scales.
  *The page went blurry and stayed that way* — `UpdateDesiredTiles` returned
  early whenever `ScrollViewer.ZoomFactor != 1`, and only a settling
  `ViewChanged` ever reset it. A missed one left the tile pipeline permanently
  unable to request a crisp tile. It now folds the factor in itself rather than
  giving up. Also fixed a stale-key leak in the v0.5.0 form-refresh sets that
  made evicted tiles get re-requested forever.
  **Rebuilt the notice surface.** The signature/XFA notice was a raw `InfoBar`
  in the window overlay, so it stretched across the sidebar with its text
  clipped, covered the find bar, and reopened itself after every page edit
  because its close button recorded nothing. It is now `NoticeHost` — a compact
  floating card bounded to the document area — and it is the app's *only*
  message channel, replacing the error bar that had the same stretch bug and
  was announcing successful flattens in red with error semantics. Dialogs also
  now inherit the app theme instead of the OS's. 118 → 197 tests.
  **Pre-submission security pass** (same release, before the Store upload):
  PDFium bumped to **152.0.7961** — it parses untrusted input, so its releases
  carry Chrome's PDF fixes and a stale pin is the largest avoidable risk in a
  submission. **`UpdateService` deleted**: with distribution moving to the Store,
  the self-updater had nothing to update from, and removing it took with it the
  app's only network code *and* a download path that verified neither hash nor
  signature. Rune now makes no network requests in any build, which is what turns
  the privacy declaration and the `runFullTrust` justification from conditional
  claims into unconditional ones. Whole-page renders are clamped to a pixel
  budget: `RenderRegion` computed `width × 4 × height` in `int`, and a page may
  declare a MediaBox up to the PDF maximum of 14400 pt, which overflows to a
  negative at print resolution and threw out of `ArrayPool.Rent`. Tiles were
  never exposed (capped at 1024 px); print and thumbnails were. 197 → 209 tests.

## 10. Known bugs

**Two open: a combo box that will not drop its list, and a picker failure that is
not Rune's to fix.** Everything else below is fixed, kept because each cause is
worth remembering. The three v0.4.1 bugs are listed in
full; the rest have their post-mortems in §9 — the two zoom/blur bugs and the
invisible hover ghost (v0.5.x), in v0.6.0 the fourteen rotation guards,
`Rotate()` discarding the user's find results, and a typed-signature preview
that inherited the dialog's white foreground onto white paper, in v0.7.0 the
dead render thread after a tab switch, erasing a stamp leaving nothing to undo,
and the eraser's redo removing the wrong annotation, and in v0.8.0 the Store
package shipping with no .NET runtime in it, the text-box chords reaching the
document past the caret, and a text-box resize rescaling the type.

**The one worth learning from is the .NET runtime, fixed in v0.8.0.** Every Store
install from v0.4.1 to v0.7.0 opened Windows' "you must install .NET" dialog on
first launch, because the package contained no runtime. It survived four
releases, a Store certification each time, and every local test — because the
build that gets tested locally is the portable zip, and the portable zip is the
one whose command line happened to carry `--self-contained`. The MSIX never did.
**When two build paths produce the same app, assume they disagree until
something checks.** The check is `tools/check-package.ps1`, and it looks inside
the artifact rather than at the source, because the source looked fine.

**Worth repeating, because it hid a real bug for three releases:** the
tab-switch one was invisible for as long as nothing invalidated a cache. The
page kept drawing from tiles rendered before the switch, so everything looked
normal until a rotate or a night-mode toggle, at which point it went white and
stayed white. When something "sometimes" fails to redraw, suspect the render
thread's *lifetime* before suspecting the render.

0. **A combo box takes focus but its list never drops down.** Confirmed
   pre-existing, not a regression from the v0.7.0 pointer rework: a build from
   before it behaves identically. Clicking the drop button focuses the widget and
   draws its focus ring, and no popup appears. Rune hosts no combo UI of its own
   (`FormSetIndexSelected` exists in the engine with no caller), so the list is
   PDFium's own, drawn by the form-fill layer. `FFI_SetTimer`/`FFI_KillTimer` are
   deliberately NULL here (§7), which is the first thing to rule out. The value
   itself is fine: it round-trips through save, and it can be typed into.
   **Not investigated further** — it surfaced while verifying a different fix.

1. **The file picker can fail to open, transiently.** `PickSingleFileAsync`
   threw `COMException 0x80004005` three times in a row on a v0.6.0 build
   (errors.log, 2026-08-09 21:18 local). The import code was byte-identical to
   v0.5.1, where the same path demonstrably worked, so the fault was never in
   it: Windows 11 brokers these pickers into a fresh `PickerHost.exe` per call,
   and a failed activation surfaces exactly this way.
   **Not reproducible.** Tried afterwards: Ctrl+O, Save As, the flyout import,
   the pad's own Import button, five repeats in a row, and a deliberate race
   against losing the foreground. All fine, every time.
   **What was done about it:** `FilePickerHost` retries once and logs both
   attempts, so a recurrence leaves evidence of whether the retry covered it;
   the signature import no longer fires its picker from `ContentDialog.Opened`,
   which was the one genuinely fragile thing on that path; and a picker failure
   now says the picker failed rather than blaming the image. If it comes back,
   the log will say which picker and whether the retry helped.

2. ~~Navigation keys go dead after clicking a tab or the page-number box.~~
   **Fixed.** `PdfViewer` is now `IsTabStop = true` and takes focus on pointer
   press (it had to be, for form fields to receive keystrokes at all).
   `IsTextInputFocused()` additionally reports true while a PDF form field has
   focus, so arrows move the caret rather than scrolling the document.
3. ~~Selected pages are nearly invisible in light theme.~~ **Fixed.** Cause was
   the thumbnail `Border`'s opaque background painting over the ListViewItem's
   selection tint. The current page now draws its own accent ring as a second
   Border overlay (`ThumbnailItem.RingThickness`), owing nothing to the
   container. Only the *thickness* is bound — the accent brush stays in XAML as
   a `{ThemeResource}`.
4. ~~Night mode doesn't invert sidebar thumbnails.~~ **Fixed.** `DocumentView.ToBitmap`
   inverts BGRA during the copy it already performs (~55k pixels, sub-ms), and
   `PdfViewer.NightModeChanged` re-renders realized containers. The homepage
   recent-document cards are deliberately **not** inverted: the start page isn't
   a document, and night mode is a per-document reading mode.

---

## 11. Roadmap (not yet built)

- **Form JavaScript** — needs a V8-enabled PDFium build (`bblanchon.PDFium.V8.*`,
  a one-line csproj swap for a much larger binary). Without it, auto-calculating
  fields accept typed values but never recalculate.
- **Signature validation** — out of reach without a crypto stack. Rune reports
  only what the file claims plus byte-range coverage, and must never say "valid".
- **Sharper placed pictures.** An imported image is capped at 1024 px on its
  longest edge, which is `TileMath.MaxSingleTilePx` — the ceiling the on-page
  hover ghost lives under (§7). Raising it for the *file* while keeping a
  downscaled buffer for the *ghost* is the obvious next step, at the cost of
  several MB per photo, since a stamp is stored as a raw bitmap that PDFium
  compresses on save.
- More formats (ePub, CBZ — would need MuPDF; note AGPL implications)
- **Code signing** — *solved for Store installs* (the Store re-signs). Still open
  for the portable zip: Azure Trusted Signing ~$10/mo. Deferred.
- Smaller packages still. v0.6.0 took the zip from ~88 MB to **69 MB** by
  dropping the Windows App SDK's AI, ML and Widgets payload (see §7); what
  remains is the self-contained .NET + WinUI runtime, and trimming that is a
  much harder problem — `PublishTrimmed` and XAML's reflection do not get along.

---

## 12. Standing conventions

- **Never publish (repo/release/anything outward-facing) without asking first.**
- **No AI attribution in commits, PR bodies, or release notes.** History was
  rewritten on 2026-07-29 to strip `Co-Authored-By: Claude` from all 34 commits
  (the user is the sole author); don't reintroduce it.
- `main` is **branch-protected**: no force-push, no deletion. Normal pushes are
  allowed, so a PR isn't strictly required — but recent work has gone through
  PRs (#2–#5) and that reads well on a public repo.
- Verify features by **driving the real app** (screenshots), not just tests, for
  anything with a runtime surface — then commit. On-screen checks caught three
  bugs in v0.4.1 that compiled and passed 118 tests, and two more in v0.6.0 (a
  preview drawn white-on-white, and `Rotate()` throwing away the user's find
  results). **Read §13's harness notes before writing a driver** — two of those
  traps cost an hour each and both look like app bugs rather than harness bugs.
- **The Store is the promoted install path.** GitHub carries the portable zip
  only, shipped unsigned with the SAC/SmartScreen limitation documented honestly.
  Store builds are signed by Microsoft.
- Danial is **new to C#/.NET** — explain non-obvious concepts (P/Invoke, async
  void, XAML binding, MSIX) while building.
- **The website carries no JavaScript and no third-party requests.** That is what
  lets `privacy.html` say what it says, so it is a hard constraint and not a
  style preference. It rules out an embedded GitHub Sponsors widget, a shields.io
  badge on the site (the README is a different matter, it already has three), and
  any analytics. It also rules out `<video autoplay loop>` for the demos: with no
  script, CSS cannot pause, stop or seek a video, so an autoplaying loop has no
  way to honour `prefers-reduced-motion` or WCAG 2.2.2. Hence the sprite strips.
- **The looping site demos must be real captures.** `index.html` says "Every
  screenshot here is the real application, not a mockup", and a hand-drawn CSS
  animation would make that false. The application itself has no designed motion
  (no storyboards, no composition animations, and every programmatic scroll
  passes `disableAnimation: true`), so only genuinely visible behaviour can be
  filmed: the thumbnail drag-reorder, the `SplitView` slide, night mode, and the
  progressive tile pass.
- **Two things keep the demos honest, and both live in the tools.** Any motion
  added to `.demo` extends the single `prefers-reduced-motion` block in
  `style.css`, which is the only place the site turns motion off; and
  `gen-site-demos.ps1` throws on its `-MaxKB` budget rather than quietly
  doubling the page weight. The strips loop forever on purpose, because three
  passes finish at page load while the row is still offscreen, so the in-page
  "Pause the moving demos" checkbox is what answers WCAG 2.2.2.
- **Sponsorship framing.** The site asks for money two sections after promising
  "no account, no subscription, no telemetry, no ads", so the support section
  leads by saying what sponsorship is not, and puts a review and a bug report
  beside it as equals. `.github/FUNDING.yml` and the four site links point at one
  profile and resolve only once that profile is enrolled.
- Plan files from past sessions live in `~\.claude\plans\`.
- **This file is public.** Keep local paths, account addresses and anything else
  personal out of it — it ships in the repo like any other source file.

---

## 13. Current state (2026-08-18)

- Working branch **`feat/text-and-image`**, one commit ahead of `origin/main`
  (`0ebb5a0`, v0.8.0 plus the touch pass) and one behind it (the merge of
  PR #12). §9 has the release notes.
- **`origin/main` is at `62e8516`, the merge of PR #12**, so everything up to
  and including v0.7.0 is now on `main`. Local `main` is far behind still, at
  PR #3 (`ec0f18a`); it has never been fast-forwarded.
- **[PR #13](https://github.com/DanialJaved/rune/pull/13) is open** and carries
  v0.8.0 and the touch work in one commit, because the v0.8.0 changes were still
  uncommitted in the working tree and interleave with the touch changes in the
  same files. CI green, mergeable, no reviewer.
- **Nothing has been published.** No tag, no GitHub release, no Store
  submission. Tags and GitHub Releases both stop at **v0.4.0**; the Store is on
  **0.5.0**. Per §12 that all waits for the user. When it does go out it goes as
  **one v0.8.0 release**, with the notes saying plainly that the intervening
  ones went out through the Store or not at all.
- **A Store submission now matters more than it did.** Every install from the
  listing today prompts for .NET on first launch (§9, §10). Nothing in the repo
  can fix that for existing users — only a new submission can.
- **427 tests passing** (414 before the touch pass, 366 at v0.7.0, 326 at
  v0.6.0); x64 Release builds clean and CI is green on x64 and ARM64.
- **PDFium 153.0.7988**, unchanged this release.
- **Version is 0.8.0** in both `Rune.App.csproj` and `Package.appxmanifest`.
- **Neither artifact is current.** The Store bundle
  `artifacts/store/Rune.App_0.8.0.0_x64_arm64_bundle.msixupload` (141 MB) was
  built on 16 Aug, **before** the touch commit, so it is stale and has to be
  rebuilt and re-checked with `tools/check-package.ps1` before it goes anywhere.
  There is **no portable zip for 0.8.0 at all**; `artifacts/` stops at
  `rune-v0.6.0-win-x64.zip`, and §8 makes that zip the only GitHub artifact.
- **Store screenshots are still the v0.6.0 set**, 10 of 10 at 1920×1080. The
  text tool and a placed picture deserve one, and the set is full, so it would
  have to replace one.
- **Two touch behaviours are unverified**, because they need hardware this
  machine does not have. Everything else in the touch pass was checked on screen
  with injected touch pointers (§6): scrolling, hold-to-select, the markup menu,
  widening a selection, and an unchanged mouse path.
  1. **The soft keyboard actually appearing** over a form field. `TryShow()`
     returns `true`, so Windows accepts the request, but the pane stays hidden
     while a hardware keyboard is attached and the device is not in tablet
     posture. Tapping the field does focus it, which was verified.
  2. **Pen palm rejection**, which needs a digitizer to rest a hand on.

### Still to do before submitting

Neither of these can be done from the repo; both are the user's.

1. **Check the live Store description in Partner Center.** `winget show --id
   9NH37840QDM6 --source msstore` reads back a description with no
   forms/signing/flatten bullets that does **not** open with the .NET / Windows
   App SDK disclosure. The 30 July certification report ("Pass with required
   fix", policy 10.2.4.1) requires that disclosure in the first two lines. The
   corrected copy is in `docs/store-listing.md`; it may never have been pasted
   in. This is a Partner Center UI check.
2. **Publish, once the user says so.** PR #13 has to merge first. What is left
   after that: rebuild **both** artifacts for 0.8.0 (§8), since the Store bundle
   on disk predates the touch commit and there is no portable zip at all; run
   `tools/check-package.ps1` on the bundle; tag **v0.8.0**; `gh release create`;
   then the bundle and the screenshots to Partner Center. **GitHub Releases is
   still at v0.4.0** while the Store shipped 0.5.0: 0.4.1, 0.5.0, 0.5.1, 0.6.0
   and 0.7.0 were never tagged, so the notes have to say plainly that the
   intervening versions went out through the Store or not at all.

`docs/store-listing.md` carries the v0.7.0 bullets (typing on a page, placing a
picture, and picking either back up to move or resize it) on top of the v0.6.0
ones. Its own prose still has em dashes in it, unlike the README; if it is going
to be pasted into a public listing under the user's name, that is worth a pass
first (§12).


### Verified by driving the app

Everything below was checked on screen, not just by test:

- **Rotation, both directions.** A find hit lands exactly on its word and moves
  to the correct corner as the view turns (top-left → top-right → bottom-right →
  bottom-left), and hits survive the turn instead of being cleared. Drag-to-select
  was then checked at all four rotations: the selection wash lands on the glyphs,
  following the text line whichever way it runs.
- **Typed signatures**, end to end: typed, saved to the reusable list, placed on
  the page with transparency intact.
- **Signature resize**, end to end: a stamp already in the file, selected with a
  plain click, corner handles drawn, bottom-right handle dragged. 259×86 → 512×179
  on screen, with the ink filling the new box rather than the frame growing around
  an unchanged image.
- **The trimmed package**, by launching it — including night mode, the sharpest
  single check because it runs through Win2D's `InvertEffect`. Repeated against
  the final `dotnet publish` output that became the v0.6.0 zip.
- **Form filling while rotated**, the last path that had only test coverage.
  `form.pdf` at r=1: clicking the text field focuses it, the typed glyphs land
  inside it and read with the rotated content rather than the file's axes, and
  the checkbox takes its tick. Rune's own field borders sit on PDFium's widgets
  at the turn, so the two drawing paths agree.
- **The three new Store screenshots**, which is what surfaced the harness trap
  in item 4 below.
- **All four picker paths**, before and after the rework: Ctrl+O, Save As, the
  flyout import and the pad's own Import button all open and cancel cleanly, a
  photographed signature imports with the paper keyed out, and `errors.log` stays
  empty throughout.
- **Form text appearance**, end to end: typed a value, set red at 20pt through
  the right-click entry, watched the glyphs change on the page, then Ctrl+Z back
  to black 12pt and Ctrl+Y forward again.

Added for **v0.7.0**, all on `hello.pdf` unless noted:

- **A PNG with real transparency**, placed: the disc lands round with the page
  showing through its corners, not in a white box, and nothing is keyed out.
- **A JPEG photograph**, placed **while the view was rotated a quarter turn**: it
  reads upright against the content the user was looking at, its cream
  background intact (proving the matte is not on this path), and the file stores
  it turned the other way so the two cancel out.
- **The hover ghost**, at 75% over the page with its dashed outline, following
  the pointer before the click that places it.
- **Select, move, resize** of a placed picture: plain click selects, four corner
  handles draw, the bottom-right drag took it from 299 to ~410 px on screen with
  the ink filling the new box and the circle still a circle. Ctrl+Z back and
  Ctrl+Y forward.
- **The text tool** end to end: `Ctrl+T` (the accelerator this release wired),
  click on blank paper, the format bar appears over the page, typing shows in
  place, Esc commits.
- **Resizing a text box**, which is the new behaviour worth seeing: the corner
  drag **re-rendered the words at a larger point size** rather than stretching
  them, the selection frame followed the re-measured box, and undo/redo both
  came back exactly.
- **Erase and undo, all three kinds** (signature, picture, text). This is what
  the `CaptureAnnotation` fix bought: before it, Ctrl+Z after erasing a stamp did
  nothing at all.
- **Save, then reopen in Rune and in Edge.** Both render the picture with its
  alpha and the text as text. Edge additionally draws a small comment marker
  beside the text box, which is Edge showing the annotation's `/Contents` alt
  text (§7).
- **Flatten, then find.** Searching the flattened document for a word that was
  typed reports **1 of 1** and highlights it on the page. That is the whole
  point of the Stage 0 probe, confirmed end to end rather than inferred.
- **Night mode after a tab switch**, which is how the dead-render-thread fix was
  confirmed: two tabs, switch across and back, `Ctrl+I`, and every tile and
  thumbnail re-renders inverted. Before the fix they stayed as they were, and a
  rotate left them white permanently.
- **Form editing**, all four routes that were broken, on `form.pdf`: backspace
  takes exactly one character off (not two, which is what a double-routed key
  would do); Shift+Home draws a real selection highlight and typing replaces it;
  dragging across the value selects the part dragged over; Ctrl+A selects the
  lot. The checkbox still takes its tick through the split press and release,
  which is the regression that rework could have caused.

Nothing with a runtime surface is now unverified on screen.

### Notes on the screenshot harness

A DPI-aware `SendInput` driver lives in the session scratchpad. Seven traps have
cost real time here and will again if it is rebuilt. The last three are from
v0.7.0, and all three present as "the app is ignoring input" when the app is
fine. **Capturing with `CopyFromScreen` over the window rect and clicking at
`windowLeft + x` avoids trap 4 entirely**, which is why the driver now does that
rather than `PrintWindow`.

1. **The `INPUT` struct must be exactly 40 bytes on x64.** Any trailing padding
   makes `SendInput` fail with `ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER`, silently — the cursor
   still moves because `SetCursorPos` is a separate call, so it looks like the
   app is ignoring clicks.
2. **Declare per-monitor DPI awareness before anything else.** Without it
   `GetWindowRect` returns logical coordinates while `PrintWindow` renders
   physical pixels, so on this 125% display every capture is cropped to the left
   ~80% of the window. That cost an hour: it looks exactly like the header's
   right-hand buttons having vanished, and every coordinate read off such a
   capture is then wrong, which in turn looks like pointer input not reaching the
   Win2D canvas. **It does reach it** — drags, clicks and right-clicks on the
   page all work.
3. **Bound pixel searches to the page.** The document background is dark in this
   theme, so a naive "find the dark pixels" glyph search matches the app's own
   chrome, and a page-bounded search still catches the gap between two pages.
   Locating text by running a find and looking for the highlight colour is far
   more robust than looking for dark pixels.
4. **`PrintWindow` captures the WINDOW rect; clicks go to CLIENT coordinates,
   and on a restored window the two differ by 9 px in x.** So a coordinate read
   off a capture has to have that subtracted before it is clicked. Big targets
   absorb the error and small ones do not, which is the worst possible failure
   mode: the toolbar buttons, the flyout entries and the dialog fields all
   worked, so it read as "clicking a placed signature does not select it" (an
   app bug) rather than "the click is 9 px off" (a harness bug). Probe it with
   `ClientToScreen(hwnd, {0,0})` against `GetWindowRect` instead of assuming
   zero. Related: `Focus-Rune` maximizes, so calling it after sizing to
   1920×1080 silently invalidates every coordinate measured at that size.
5. **In PowerShell, `$input.mi.dwFlags = X` sets the field on a COPY.**
   `MOUSEINPUT` is a value type, so reading it through the outer struct's
   property hands back a copy that is then thrown away. `SendInput` succeeds — it
   was handed a valid `INPUT` with no flags set, which is a legal no-op — and
   every click does nothing while the cursor visibly moves. Build the inner
   struct first and assign it whole. Also: PowerShell 5.1 has no `[ushort]`
   accelerator; it is `[uint16]`, and a missing one throws at *runtime*, inside
   the function, where it is easy to miss in a wall of output.
6. **`SetCursorPos` does not inject an input event.** It moves the cursor and
   posts `WM_MOUSEMOVE`, but WinUI 3 feeds `PointerMoved` from the input queue,
   so the app never sees the move: hover previews and cursor changes simply do
   not happen, while clicks still work because `SendInput`'s button event is real
   and carries the current position. Move with
   `MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE | MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE` instead. This is what made the
   placement ghost look broken when it was not. **Declare both constants** —
   PowerShell resolves a missing `[Native]::MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE` to `$null`, `$null
   -bor $null` is 0, and the move silently becomes a no-op.
7. **Press and release need a dwell between them.** Sent as one `SendInput`
   batch they share a timestamp, and `Canvas_PointerPressed` opens with
   `if (!...IsLeftButtonPressed) return;` — by the time the handler runs the
   button is already up, so the press is dropped. Toolbar buttons still work,
   which makes it read as "placing on the canvas does nothing". ~90 ms apart is
   enough.
8. **Arrow keys and PageUp/PageDown are extended keys.** With `keybd_event`,
   pass `KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY` on *both* the down and the up, plus a real scan
   code from `MapVirtualKey(vk, 0)` rather than 0. Without it `Shift+Down` does
   not extend the thumbnail selection. Since `ThumbList_KeyDown` handles only
   `Delete` and the range extension comes from the ListView itself, that reads
   as `SelectionMode="Extended"` being broken.
9. **`mouse_event`'s absolute coordinates are normalised 0..65535 over the
   primary monitor**, not pixels: `dx = round(screenX * 65535 / (SM_CXSCREEN -
   1))`. Absent from the notes above because that driver used `SendInput`.
   Absolute rather than relative also removes pointer-acceleration
   nondeterminism, which is what makes a take repeatable.
10. **DPI awareness latches once per process, and then both setters fail.** A
